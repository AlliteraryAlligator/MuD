WASHINGTON, April 9 (Reuters) - Fox News said on Sunday it has reached a settlement with a Venezuelan businessman Majed Khalil, ending a defamation case in which Khalil said he was falsely accused on air of helping to rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election against Donald Trump.
Khalil had filed a defamation suit against the news outlet and former host Lou Dobbs, arguing in filings that they had fabricated claims he and other Venezuelans were involved in ""orchestrating a non-existent scheme to rig or fix the election"" against the former Republican president.
A short letter sent to U.S. District Judge Louis Stanton in Manhattan on Saturday said the parties had reached a ""confidential agreement to resolve this matter"" and expected to file a joint stipulation of dismissal next week.
""This matter has been resolved amicably by both sides. We have no further comment,"" Fox News said in a statement on Sunday.
Lawyers for Fox News and Dobbs referred Reuters to the statement. Khalil's lawyer did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
Trump has continued to repeat debunked claims of widespread voting fraud as reason for his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election even after they have been roundly rejected by courts, state governments and members of his own former administration.
Jury selection is set to begin on Thursday ahead of a separate trial in Dominion Voting Systems Corp's $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News and its parent company Fox Corp (FOXA.O) over their coverage of debunked election-rigging claims.

CARACAS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition election commission said on Monday it will move forward with its late October primary vote to pick its presidential candidate for next year's general election, after the country's national electoral council sought a delay.
The South American nation's beleaguered political opposition will face off against President Nicolas Maduro's ruling socialists, who have presided over a prolonged economic meltdown marked by sky-high inflation and persecution of critics, according to rights groups.
Maduro is expected to run for re-election, but has not yet made a formal announcement.
Last month, the National Electoral Council (CNE) - seen by the opposition as aligned with Maduro - responded to a June request to assist with the opposition's primary, saying it could provide voting centers and machines but stressing more time was needed to help organize the primary vote for later in November.
But most of the 13 opposition candidates rejected this request, preferring to keep the Oct. 22 primary, while criticizing what they called a slow CNE response.
The opposition commission - made up of eight lawyers and experts - said it had asked for up to 400 additional voting centers as well as security at the centers and help facilitating visas for electoral experts and foreign journalists covering the process.
In its own statement later on Monday, the CNE insisted it holds ""exclusive competency"" to organize elections but would provide technical support to the opposition ""to guarantee a reliable, transparent process"" that promotes participation and security.
The statement did not address the primary election's date.
Venezuela's opposition counts some 3,000 voting centers, according to commission president Jesus Maria Casal.
Some 14,000 Venezuelan schools typically serve as electoral centers for the country's 20 million voters, but since the primary is being carried out independently, these cannot be used without CNE authorization.
Venezuelan authorities have in recent months disqualified some opposition candidates, including former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado, the opposition's leading hopeful in polls.

CARACAS/WASHINGTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Venezuela's government and its political opposition on Tuesday agreed to electoral guarantees for 2024 presidential elections, paving the way for possible U.S. sanctions relief, though the deal did not lift bans on opposition candidates barred from public office.
The elections will take place in the second half of next year, and international observers - including from the European Union and United Nations - will oversee the vote, according to terms unveiled following a resumption of long-suspended talks.
Multiple sources had said ahead of Tuesday's announcement that the U.S. was prepared to ease some oil-related sanctions on OPEC member-nation Venezuela if Washington was satisfied President Nicolas Maduro had given enough ground to the opposition.
President Joe Biden's administration had said it would lift some long-standing punitive measures in exchange for democratic concessions from Maduro.
But as the White House studied the details of the agreement finalized in Barbados, it was unclear how soon the U.S. might act or how far it could go with sanctions relief.
""We welcome the Venezuelan-led political agreement reached today in Barbados,"" according to a joint statement from the U.S., EU, Britain and Canada, calling it a necessary step toward the ""restoration of democracy in Venezuela.""
However, the statement also reiterated calls for release of political prisoners, independence of the electoral process, freedom of expression and respect for human rights, issues that were not covered in Tuesday's agreement.
Reuters reported last week that Venezuela and the U.S. had progressed at their own talks in Qatar toward a deal that could allow at least one additional foreign oil firm to take Venezuelan crude oil for debt repayment if Maduro resumed negotiations with the opposition.
Any significant alleviation of oil sanctions would mark a further shift by the Biden administration away from former President Donald Trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign against the socialist-led South American country.
But U.S. sources have said any U.S. policy changes would be reversible if Maduro failed to meet his election commitments. Oil revenues are crucial to Venezuela's crippled economy.
Tuesday's meeting in Barbados, brokered by Norway, was the first between the two sides in 11 months.
The talks, meant to provide a way out of Venezuela's long-running political and economic crisis, will continue at an unspecified date, the parties said, adding they are committed to respecting the results of the vote.
The deal says each side can choose its 2024 candidate according to its internal rules, but did not reverse bans on some opposition figures - including Oct. 22 primary frontrunner Maria Corina Machado - that prevent them from holding office.
The opposition has said the bans, handed down by the controller general, are unlawful and Washington has rejected any roadblocks to opposition candidates.
""If you have an administrative inhabilitation...from the controller general of the republic you cannot be a candidate, I want to clarify that,"" Jorge Rodriguez, the head of the government delegation told a press conference after the signing.
Speaking before Rodriguez, the head of the opposition delegation Gerardo Blyde had said the deal could allow banned candidates to ""recover their rights.""
The opposition has shied away from laying out what could happen if Machado were to win the primary but could not register for the general election.
It remains unclear whether the often-fractious opposition would accept her choosing another candidate to run in her stead.
At least two candidates who initially had been set to run in the primary have bowed out because they are banned.
Maduro, president since 2013, is expected to run for re-election but has not yet formalized his candidacy.
The U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela to punish Maduro's government following a 2018 election that Washington considered a sham. Since 2019, U.S. sanctions have banned PDVSA from exporting its oil to its chosen markets.
The other accord signed by the two sides includes an agreement to protect Houston-based oil refiner Citgo Petroleum, whose parent company's shares will be put for auction starting this month through a court-organized process to pay creditors.

"[1/14]Industrial engineer and former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado addresses supporters as she reacts to the vote count, after Venezuelans voted in a primary to choose a unity opposition candidate to face Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in his probable re-election bid in 2024, in Caracas,...

CARACAS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado is leading the vote count in the Venezuelan opposition's presidential primary by a huge margin and has claimed victory in the Sunday contest, with final results pending.
The vote to choose a unity opposition candidate to face President Nicolas Maduro in his probable re-election bid next year came amid pledges by the United States to roll back sanctions relief if the government fails to lift bans preventing some opposition figures from holding office.
Machado was tallying 93% of the vote, with just over 26% of ballot boxes counted, the primary's organizing commission said around midnight.
""From tonight we begin a great movement for a great national alliance for the transformation of Venezuela,"" Machado said at her campaign headquarters.
""Today I received a mandate and I accept with Venezuelans the commitment of making that mandate matter.""
The count - delayed by a server blockage - was expected to resume later on Monday. It was unclear when the next results update would be given.
Machado's nearest rival, former lawmaker Carlos Prosperi, had 4.75% of the vote.
Participation in the vote, organized without state help, was more than double what had been expected in some states. Venezuela has about 20 million eligible voters.
Polling places - including in private homes and on street corners - were meant to close at 4 p.m. (2000 GMT), but many remained opened hours later, so those waiting in long lines could vote or so additional ballots could be delivered.
Some of the estimated 3,000 polling locations nationwide had to be moved, according to human rights groups and voters, causing confusion.
Voters also faced transportation problems. Gasoline availability was limited in border states Tachira and Bolivar and public transport in the country's interior was working irregularly, according to Reuters witnesses.
""On Friday we waited in three lines to be able to get gasoline for today and we couldn't,"" said housewife Melissa Diaz, 39, who arrived at her polling place in eastern Guyana City with a nearly empty tank.
""We've lost a whole day, but even if we had to walk or cycle, we were coming to vote.""
Machado, 56, an industrial engineer, has led her rivals by some 40 points in polls.
But Machado, like two former rivals who dropped out of the race, is barred from public office over her support of the sanctions on Maduro's government and would not be able to register for the general election.
The opposition and government this week signed a deal on some election guarantees, including the presence of international observers. The accord allows each side to choose its candidate according to internal rules, but did not retract the election disqualifications.
The United States, which broadly eased Trump-era sanctions on Venezuelan oil and gas and bonds in response to the deal, has said Maduro has until the end of November to begin rescinding the bans and releasing political prisoners and ""wrongfully detained"" Americans.
Though five people were released, lead government negotiator Jorge Rodriguez confirmed this week that those with disqualifications cannot run in the 2024 contest, set for the second half of the year.
Some in the opposition have said they are skeptical Maduro will follow through on the deal.
The opposition, which says the disqualifications are unlawful, has been reticent to say what it would do if Machado wins the primary but is unable to compete in 2024.
Machado - who says her goal is to remove Maduro in a fair and peaceful vote - has said she would pressure the electoral authorities to let her register. Maduro has not announced that he will seek re-election, but many observers expect him to run.
Others have argued selecting a substitute candidate would be necessary, although whether the often-fractious opposition would accept Machado choosing a replacement remains to be seen.
Ten candidates are competing in the primary, where candidates have pledged to come up with solutions for the country's long economic crisis.
""If you buy diapers you don't buy food, so I buy food and not diapers,"" said 20-year-old hairdresser Rosimar Gonzalez, who voted in central Maracay with her young son in her arms.
""We have to change presidents.""
About 4 million of the 7.7 million Venezuelans migrants who have left their country are estimated to be of voting age and are able to vote at centers in 28 countries.
""I came to vote because I want to hug my grandchildren again, because I want to see my country on the road to freedom before I go,"" said a teary Armando Cedeno, 100, who voted in the afternoon in Maracaibo.
""I am confident that God will give me that gift.""
(This story has been corrected to say the vote count will resume on Monday in paragraph 6)

"CARACAS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Venezuela's Supreme Justice Tribunal said on Monday it has suspended the results of an opposition presidential primary that took place this month, despite an electoral deal between the government and the opposition that allows each side to choose its candidate.
The ruling could risk the wrath of the United States, which this month rolled back some oil and gas industry and bond trading sanctions in exchange for the electoral deal.
The U.S. State Department has already said it will reinstate sanctions if the government of President Nicolas Maduro does not lift bans on some opposition candidates and free political prisoners and ""wrongfully detained"" Americans by the end of November.
The decision by the court, which the opposition considers an arm of the government, comes after the attorney general announced last week that his office is investigating the primary and members of its organizing commission for electoral violations, financial crimes and conspiracy.
Members of the organizing commission were meeting with prosecutors on Monday for interviews related to the case, the commission said on social media.
The opposition and the primary's winner Maria Corina Machado have insisted repeatedly the Oct. 22 vote was transparent and fair.
The government has decried alleged fraud since the day of the vote, which was organized without state help and which attracted more than 2.3 million voters.
The government of Maduro, in power for a decade, and the opposition signed an electoral deal in Barbados, agreeing to international observers and that each side can choose its candidate according to internal rules.

""We urge Nicolas Maduro and his representatives to uphold the commitments they made at the signing of the political roadmap agreement,"" a State Department spokesperson said. ""The U.S. government will take action if Maduro and his representatives do not meet their commitments.""
Both the investigation and the ruling come at the request of lawmaker Jose Brito, who the court said wanted to participate in the primary.
Brito does not belong to any of the parties that took part.
""Following the request of preventative protection and in consequence, all the effects of the distinct phases of the electoral process conducted by the National Primary Commission are suspended,"" the tribunal said on its website.
The commission must present all documents related to its creation, candidate registration, voting records and other documents, the tribunal said.
The commission must also account for the participation of candidates like Machado, who is barred from holding public office in a decision the opposition says is illegal.
The ruling ""temporarily suspends the primary until there is a final decision from the tribunal,"" said lawyer and university professor Jose Vicente Haro. ""The tribunal is late to the decision because it comes after the primary. They shouldn't have accepted the petition.""
Some observers said the opposition parties that participated in the primary should simply recognize Machado once again as their unity candidate, making any ruling on the contest moot.
The opposition this month declined electoral authorities' offer of help organize the primary, and its request to delay the vote until November, after the authorities took several months to respond to the opposition's request for assistance.
