Five hours after polling ended, the National Electoral Council announced the opposition had won 99 seats. President Maduro has admitted defeat, recognising \"these adverse results\". It is the worst-ever defeat for the leftist movement founded by former leader Hugo Chavez in 1999. The Socialists have gained 46 seats, with another 22 yet to be declared. Results arrived much later than expected, five hours after polls closed. Fireworks erupted over the capital, Caracas, soon after. Among the campaign issues were chronic food shortages of staples - such as milk, rice, coffee, sugar, corn flour and cooking oil. Venezuela has been hit hard by the continuing low price of oil, its main export. It also has the continent's highest inflation rate. Mr Maduro has blamed the situation on an \"economic war\" waged by the opposition. \"We have come with our morals and our ethics [intact] to recognize these adverse results, to accept them and to say to our Venezuela that the constitution and democracy have triumphed. \"We have lost a battle today, but the struggle to build a new society is just beginning.\" - Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's president and head of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. \"The results are as we hoped.

Amid food shortages stemming from a severe economic crisis turnout was low. The National Electoral Council (CNE) put it at just 46% but the opposition alleges it was even lower. The main opposition candidate, Henri Falc\u00f3n, rejected the result soon after the polls closed and called for new elections.  \"We do not recognise this electoral process as valid... we have to have new elections in Venezuela,\" he said. With more than 90% of the votes counted, Mr Maduro had 67.7% - 5.8 million votes - CNE chief Tibisay Lucena announced. Mr Falc\u00f3n had won 21.2% - 1.8 million votes - she said. With Venezuela's main opposition coalition boycotting the election, a win by President Maduro had been widely expected. What observers were more interested in was to see how many Venezuelans would turn out to vote. The CNE said turnout would probably rise to 48%, still well below the figure in the 2013 presidential election, when almost 80% of eligible voters cast their ballots. The opposition, however, accused the CNE of inflating its figures and claimed the real number was closer to 30%. A source within the CNE told Reuters that only 32.3% of eligible voters had cast their ballot by 18:00 local time, when most voting stations closed.  Under the Venezuelan constitution, the CNE is the official independent body responsible for overseeing and guaranteeing the transparency of all elections.  It is made up of five members.

The ruling could risk the wrath of the United States, which this month rolled back some oil and gas industry and bond trading sanctions in exchange for the electoral deal. The U.S. State Department has already said it will reinstate sanctions if the government of President Nicolas Maduro does not lift bans on some opposition candidates and free political prisoners and \"wrongfully detained\" Americans by the end of November. The decision by the court, which the opposition considers an arm of the government, comes after the attorney general announced last week that his office is investigating the primary and members of its organizing commission for electoral violations, financial crimes and conspiracy. Members of the organizing commission were meeting with prosecutors on Monday for interviews related to the case, the commission said on social media. The opposition and the primary's winner Maria Corina Machado have insisted repeatedly the Oct. 22 vote was transparent and fair. The government has decried alleged fraud since the day of the vote, which was organized without state help and which attracted more than 2.3 million voters. The government of Maduro, in power for a decade, and the opposition signed an electoral deal in Barbados, agreeing to international observers and that each side can choose its candidate according to internal rules.

Maduro is expected to run for re-election, but has not yet made a formal announcement. Last month, the National Electoral Council (CNE) - seen by the opposition as aligned with Maduro - responded to a June request to assist with the opposition's primary, saying it could provide voting centers and machines but stressing more time was needed to help organize the primary vote for later in November. But most of the 13 opposition candidates rejected this request, preferring to keep the Oct. 22 primary, while criticizing what they called a slow CNE response. The opposition commission - made up of eight lawyers and experts - said it had asked for up to 400 additional voting centers as well as security at the centers and help facilitating visas for electoral experts and foreign journalists covering the process. In its own statement later on Monday, the CNE insisted it holds \"exclusive competency\" to organize elections but would provide technical support to the opposition \"to guarantee a reliable, transparent process\" that promotes participation and security. The statement did not address the primary election's date. Venezuela's opposition counts","16":"Publication date: Oct 18, 2023 ...

The elections will take place in the second half of next year, and international observers - including from the European Union and United Nations - will oversee the vote, according to terms unveiled following a resumption of long-suspended talks. Multiple sources had said ahead of Tuesday's announcement that the U.S. was prepared to ease some oil-related sanctions on OPEC member-nation Venezuela if Washington was satisfied President Nicolas Maduro had given enough ground to the opposition. President Joe Biden's administration had said it would lift some long-standing punitive measures in exchange for democratic concessions from Maduro. But as the White House studied the details of the agreement finalized in Barbados, it was unclear how soon the U.S. might act or how far it could go with sanctions relief. \"We welcome the Venezuelan-led political agreement reached today in Barbados,\" according to a joint statement from the U.S., EU, Britain and Canada, calling it a necessary step toward the \"restoration of democracy in Venezuela.\" However, the statement also reiterated calls for release of political prisoners, independence of the electoral process, freedom of expression and respect for human rights, issues that were not covered in Tuesday's agreement.

President Nicolas Maduro is expected to seek another term. The primary is the first the opposition has held in 11 years. It has not backed a presidential candidate in a general election since 2013. The government and the opposition said in a joint agreement signed on Tuesday that each side can choose its candidate according to its own internal rules. The primary could be a chance for the opposition to rally support from voters in Venezuela, whose economy has been in deep crisis for years. The U.S. has long said it would lift some of its sanctions on Maduro's government in exchange for democratic concessions from the president. Sources this week said Washington would consider some relief in response to Tuesday's deal. Opposition politicians have organized the primary without state assistance after the National Electoral Council took months to respond to a request for logistical help. Officials who are found guilty of corruption are banned from holding public office for up to 15 years. Venezuela's opposition says the government uses bans unlawfully to prevent them from competing in elections. Maria Corina Machado, who is expected to win the primary, has been barred from holding public office since June, because she supported U.S. sanctions on the Maduro government and backed former opposition leader Juan Guaido.

A new general license issued by the U.S. Treasury Department authorized OPEC member Venezuela, which had been under crushing sanctions since 2019, to produce and export oil to its chosen markets for the next six months without limitation. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed President Nicolas Maduro's electoral concessions but said Washington has given him until the end of November to begin lifting bans on opposition presidential candidates and start releasing political prisoners and \"wrongfully detained\" Americans. A senior State Department official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, threatened to reverse sanctions relief measures unless Maduro takes such action. The U.S. moves follow months of negotiations in which Washington had pressed Caracas for concrete actions toward democratic elections in return for lifting some - but not all - of the tough sanctions imposed under former U.S. President Donald Trump. It also represents a significant step in the increased engagement of President Joe Biden's administration with Maduro on issues ranging from energy to migration, a shift from Trump's \"maximum pressure\" campaign against the socialist government. Venezuela ruling party official Jorge Rodriguez, who leads the government's negotiating team at talks with the opposition, said on state television later on Wednesday that the sanctions relief affected all oil activities. \"The possibility of any person or company coming to Venezuela to invest is totally open,\" he said.

The vote to choose a unity opposition candidate to face President Nicolas Maduro in his probable re-election bid next year came amid pledges by the United States to roll back sanctions relief if the government fails to lift bans preventing some opposition figures from holding office. Machado was tallying 93% of the vote, with just over 26% of ballot boxes counted, the primary's organizing commission said around midnight. \"From tonight we begin a great movement for a great national alliance for the transformation of Venezuela,\" Machado said at her campaign headquarters. \"Today I received a mandate and I accept with Venezuelans the commitment of making that mandate matter.\" The count - delayed by a server blockage - was expected to resume later on Monday. It was unclear when the next results update would be given. Machado's nearest rival, former lawmaker Carlos Prosperi, had 4.75% of the vote.

Sanctions were widely expanded in 2019 after Maduro won re-election in what the U.S. and others say was a fraudulent vote.

The ruling could risk the wrath of the United States, which this month rolled back some oil and gas industry and bond trading sanctions in exchange for the electoral deal. The U.S. State Department has already said it will reinstate sanctions if the government of President Nicolas Maduro does not lift bans on some opposition candidates and free political prisoners and \"wrongfully detained\" Americans by the end of November. The decision by the court, which the opposition considers an arm of the government, comes after the attorney general announced last week that his office is investigating the primary and members of its organizing commission for electoral violations, financial crimes and conspiracy. Members of the organizing commission were meeting with prosecutors on Monday for interviews related to the case, the commission said on social media. The opposition and the primary's winner Maria Corina Machado have insisted repeatedly the Oct. 22 vote was transparent and fair. The government has decried alleged fraud since the day of the vote, which was organized without state help and which attracted more than 2.3 million voters.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation has estimated that 2,000 people may have been involved that day, and considers the attack an act of domestic terrorism.

Zelensky meets with G7 leaders as they\u00a0...\nA Russian news agency has published and then deleted an article prematurely praising Russia's success in invading Ukraine. It applauds Russian President Vladimir Putin for solving the Ukraine \"problem\", saying that \"Ukraine has returned to Russia\" through military action. It suggests the author anticipated a rapid victory and the piece was published prematurely. The article, published by the state-owned RIA-Novosti news agency on Saturday (26 February) and described by Christo Grozev of fact-checkers Bellingcat as \"extremely shocking, even for Kremlin standards\", was quickly deleted from its website. Other Twitter users called it Russia's \"victory celebration\". However, it still remains visible on the Internet Archive website, and at the time of writing it's also visible on a regional page of Russia's government-owned Sputnik news site. A syndicated version in English entitled \"The New World Order\" can also be seen on the website of Pakistan's Frontier Post. Many Twitter users presumed the editorial piece was intended for publication after a swift Russian victory in Ukraine. In it, contributor Petr Akopov claims that Russia is returning to lead a new world order, while making good the \"terrible catastrophe\" that was the end of the Soviet Union in 1991. It is headlined \"The arrival of Russia in a new world\", but the Russian word for \"arrival\" (nastuplenie) can also mean \"attack\". Mr Akopov justifies the \"virtual civil war\" as \"Russia restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together\". Moscow is drawing together \"Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians (Ukrainians)\", he says, suggesting a Russian plan to increase its sphere of influence. The architect of this act of reunion is, of course, Mr Putin, who is praised for taking action now, rather than leaving the situation to be resolved in the future. \"Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a","35":"Publication date: ... 2022.

In a phone call on between the two leaders, Scholz agreed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that independent investigations by the International Atomic Energy Agency would remove any doubt about Ukraine-initiated preparation of such a bomb, the readout said. The IAEA said Monday that investigators had begun their inspection of two locations that Russia said Ukraine was using to develop such bombs.

Putin insisted Russia had not \u201cgone mad\u201d and that it saw its own nuclear arsenal as a purely defensive deterrent. He said: We haven\u2019t gone mad, we realise what nuclear weapons are. We have these means in more advanced and modern form than any other nuclear country, that\u2019s an obvious fact. But we aren\u2019t about to run around the world brandishing this weapon like a razor. He went on to claim that Russia \u201ccould be the only guarantor of Ukraine\u2019s territorial integrity\u201d, adding: It\u2019s up to the new leaders of Ukraine. It\u2019s 9pm in Kyiv. Here\u2019s where we stand: President Vladimir Putin has admitted that Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine could turn into a \u201clong-term process\u201d. Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack. Putin also claimed that Russia would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict, denied that Russian troops were deserting in mass from the field of battle, and claimed that the Russian military would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia. Nato\u2019s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Russia is attempting to \u201cfreeze\u201d the fighting in Ukraine over the winter to prepare its forces for a renewed assault early next year.

After a series of humiliating retreats, his initial invasion plan has clearly failed, but Russia's war is far from over. Even now, Russia's leader describes the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two as a \"special military operation\". Not the full-scale war that has bombed civilians across Ukraine and left more than 13 million either as refugees abroad or displaced inside their own country.  His declared goal on 24 February 2022 was to \"demilitarise and denazify\" Ukraine and not occupy it by force, days after backing independence for eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014.  He vowed to protect people from eight years of Ukrainian bullying and genocide - a Russian propaganda claim with no foundation in reality. He spoke of preventing Nato from gaining a foothold in Ukraine, then added another objective of ensuring Ukraine's neutral status. President Putin never said it out loud, but high on the agenda was toppling the government of Ukraine's elected president. \"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two,\" said Volodymyr Zelensky. Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound, according to his adviser.  Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide never added up, but Russian state-run news agency Ria Novosti explained that \"denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation\" - in effect, erasing the modern state of Ukraine. For years, the Russian president has denied Ukraine its own statehood, writing in a lengthy 2021 essay that \"Russians and Ukrainians were one people\" dating back to the late 9th Century.

The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt is the only remaining outlet to get people out of the enclave and supplies into it, but it has been closed for much of the past week.

The estimate represents roughly half the population of northern Gaza, where the IDF is gearing up for the next stages of its war with Hamas, which runs the territory. The evacuation advisory came after Israel imposed a complete siege on Gaza. The IDF said Saturday it would allow safe movement on specified streets for residents to move from the northern city of Beit Hanoun to Khan Yunis in the south \u2014 a roughly 20-mile distance of rubble-strewn streets.

The first convoy of aid trucks passed through the Rafah crossing and entered besieged Gaza on Saturday morning, as the Israeli military said\u00a0...\nFive armed Palestinian groups joined Hamas in the deadly 7 October attack on Israel after training together in military-style exercises from 2020 onwards, BBC News analysis shows. The groups carried out joint drills in Gaza which closely resembled the tactics used during the deadly assault - including at a site less than 1km (0.6 miles) from the barrier with Israel - and posted them on social media.  They practised hostage-taking, raiding compounds and breaching Israel's defences during these exercises, the last of which was held just 25 days before the attack. BBC Arabic and BBC Verify have collated evidence which shows how Hamas brought together Gaza's factions to hone their combat methods - and ultimately execute a raid into Israel which has plunged the region into war.  On 29 December 2020, Hamas's overall leader Ismail Haniyeh declared the first of four drills codenamed Strong Pillar a \"strong message and a sign of unity\" between Gaza's various armed factions. As the most powerful of Gaza's armed groups, Hamas was the dominant force in a coalition which brought together 10 other Palestinian factions in a war games-style exercise overseen by a \"joint operation room\". The structure was set up in 2018 to coordinate Gaza's armed factions under a central command.  Prior to 2018, Hamas had formally coordinated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Gaza's second largest armed faction and - like Hamas - a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries. Hamas had also fought alongside other groups in previous conflicts, but the 2020 drill was billed in propaganda as evidence a wider array of groups were being unified. Hamas's leader said the first drill reflected the \"permanent readiness\" of the armed factions. The 2020 exercise was the first of four joint drills held over three years, each"},"publication_date":{"0":[2015,12,7],"1":[2018,5,21],"2":[2023,10,2],"3":[2023,10,22],"4":[2023,10,26],"5":[2023,10,31],"6":[2021,1,6],"7":[2021,1,6],"8":[2021,1,6],"9":[2021,2,9],"10":[2021,2,10],"11":[2021,10,22],"12":[2022,12,23],"13":[2022,12,23],"14":[2023,2,15],"15":[2023,10,2],"16":[2023,10,17],"17":[2023,10,18],"18":[2023,10,19],"19":[2023,10,22],"20":[2023,10,26],"21":[2023,10,30],"22":[2023,10,31],"23":[2021,1,6],"24":[2022,12,6],"25":[2022,12,7],"26":[2022,12,18],"27":[2022,12,19],"28":[2022,12,19],"29":[2022,12,19],"30":[2023,3,25],"31":[2023,7,18],"32":[2023,8,7],"33":[2022,2,24],"34":[2022,2,28],"35":[2022,10,31],"36":[2022,11,2],"37":[2022,11,23],"38":[2022,12,7],"39":[2022,12,15],"40":[2023,2,23],"41":[2023,10,15],"42":[2023,10,16],"43":[2023,10,17],"44":[2023,10,18],"45":[2023,10,21],"46":[2023,11,27]}}
