on opposition candidates and release political prisoners by the end of November.","24":"The Supreme Justice Tribunal in Venezuela has suspended the results of the opposition presidential primary, risking the reinstatement of U.S. sanctions.","25":"The ruling comes after the attorney general announced an investigation into the primary and its organizing commission for electoral violations and
