Fireworks erupted over the capital, Caracas, soon after.\nAmong the campaign issues were chronic food shortages of staples - such as milk, rice, coffee, sugar, corn flour and cooking oil.\nVenezuela has been hit hard by the continuing low price of oil, its main export. It also has the continent's highest inflation rate.\nMr Maduro has blamed the situation on an \"economic war\" waged by the opposition.\n\"We have come with our morals and our ethics [intact] to recognize these adverse results, to accept them and to say to our Venezuela that the constitution and democracy have triumphed.\n\"We have lost a battle today, but the struggle to build a new society is just beginning.\" - Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's president and head of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela.\n\"The results are as we hoped. Venezuela has won. It's irreversible,\" tweeted (in Spanish) Henrique Capriles, a leading opposition figure in the Democratic Unity Roundtable and a former presidential challenger.\n\"Venezuela wanted a change and that change came. A new majority expressed itself and sent a clear and resounding message.\" - Jesus Torrealba - opposition coalition chief.\nThe opposition alliance, made up of centrist and conservative parties, is confident of ultimately taking at least 112 seats after 16 years of socialist control.\nAccording to senior figures in the alliance, that would allow them to pass laws allowing the release of political prisoners and to reverse, for example, appointments to senior legal positions made by the current government, says the BBC's Wyre Davies, in Caracas.\nIt also gives stronger momentum to the opposition should it wish to call a referendum on Mr Maduro's future. This could take place only when his presidency reaches its halfway point in April next year.\nHowever, under Venezuela's presidential system the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) will still be a powerful force, as it controls many municipalities.\nThe next presidential election is due in April 2019.\nThe elections were widely seen as a referendum on President Maduro, the handpicked successor of the late President Hugo Chavez, and the party's socialist policies.\nThe opposition accused the PSUV of mismanaging the economy and of squandering the country's oil wealth.\nMr Maduro says his party defends the interests of ordinary Venezuelans and wants to complete Mr Chavez's \"Bolivarian Revolution\".\nThe opposition also accused the government of increasing authoritarianism.\nEarlier this year, opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was given a 13-year prison sentence for inciting violence - a charge critics say was politically motivated.\nVenezuela elections: Why did Maduro's Socialists lose?\n'Devastating night' for Socialists\nVenezuela's economy on the brink?\nVenezuelan healthcare in collapse\nLiving with Venezuela's high inflation\nVenezuela opposition leader killed\nPush for Venezuela to allow observers\nNeighbours to give Venezuela food\nVenezuela decree powers divide opinion\nRussia luring migrants from Finnish border for war in Ukraine\nIsraeli tanks shell Jabalia camp as heavy fighting continues in north Gaza\nHaley under attack and more Republican debate takeaways\nBBC reporter in Gaza: People here are traumatised and exhausted\nHaley under attack and more Republican debate takeaways\n'My baby died after they pushed our boat away'\nFamilies searching for sons in drug war 'until last heartbeat'\nThe young Chinese who stood up to Xi's Covid rules\nHow is my country doing tackling climate change?\nIsraeli settler violence brings destruction and fear to West Bank\nZelensky speaks out as US stand-off imperils war effort\nHow a toy becomes the coveted holiday 'it' gift\nWhy US travellers are snubbing budget airlines\nBerlin's stunning indoor public pools\nThe scandalous queens of 1910s New York\n\u00c2\u00a9 2023 BBC.

Mr Falc\u00f3n had won 21.2% - 1.8 million votes - she said.\nWith Venezuela's main opposition coalition boycotting the election, a win by President Maduro had been widely expected. What observers were more interested in was to see how many Venezuelans would turn out to vote.\nThe CNE said turnout would probably rise to 48%, still well below the figure in the 2013 presidential election, when almost 80% of eligible voters cast their ballots.\nThe opposition, however, accused the CNE of inflating its figures and claimed the real number was closer to 30%. A source within the CNE told Reuters that only 32.3% of eligible voters had cast their ballot by 18:00 local time, when most voting stations closed. \nUnder the Venezuelan constitution, the CNE is the official independent body responsible for overseeing and guaranteeing the transparency of all elections. \nIt is made up of five members. The opposition alleges that four of the five are government stooges and therefore does not trust the body to be independent.\nLuis Emilio Rond\u00f3n, the one CNE member which has been critical of the government, said he did not recognise the results because \"Venezuelans' freedom to vote\" had not been respected.  \nMr Maduro and his supporters were jubilant. The 55 year old told cheering crowds outside the presidential palace in Caracas that \"the revolution is here to stay!\".\nHis supporters chanted \"let's go, Nico!\" as fireworks went off and confetti was fired in the air.\nHe also mocked his main rival, Mr Falc\u00f3n, saying he had been left \"groggy\" by the knockout victory Mr Maduro had achieved.  \nAnd while on the one hand he called for dialogue with the opposition, he also told supporters that \"the opposition must leave us alone to govern\".\nPrevious attempts at dialogue between the opposition and the government have failed. \nThe main opposition coalition had warned that the election would not be free and fair.\nIt said the poll had been brought forward from December 2018 to take advantage of disarray within opposition ranks and that some of the most promising candidates had been banned from standing or jailed, while many others had fled the country. \nThat is why it called for a boycott. Mr Falc\u00f3n however broke ranks, arguing Venezuelans should be given a chance to vote Mr Maduro out of office.\nBut following the vote, he too alleged it had been rigged in Mr Maduro's favour, by abuse of the scanning of state-issued benefits cards used for accessing food. He has called for a rerun.\nBy Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent, Caracas\nSuch was the expectation that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro would win that his rivals admitted defeat, denouncing the result before it had even been announced. There was never going to be any result other than a Maduro victory - and Venezuelans knew that. \nIt feels like most people here are no longer outraged. Disappointed, maybe, but it's par for the course in a country where political freedom feels increasingly limited. \nMr Maduro has promised change in Venezuela - why he needed a second mandate to do that is anyone's guess. He's already been in the job five years. Added to that, change for the better under Mr Maduro is unlikely. With international pressure likely to build after these results, and with a crumbling economy, his job is harder than ever - as are the lives of Venezuelans.\nAs polling started, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced the election as a \"sham\" on Twitter.\nThe US mission to the United Nations called the process an \"insult to democracy\" and Chile and Panama said that they would not recognise the result.  \nEl Salvador and Cuba, on the other hand, congratulated President Maduro on his election win.\nAll eyes are now on the US to see whether it will impose sanctions on Venezuela's all-important oil sector, as it has threatened to do.\nThe European Union and Latin American countries had also warned ahead of the vote that they would take measures against the government if it went ahead with the election.\nThe exodus of Venezuelans leaving their country is expected to speed up further. According to International Office of Migration figures, the number of Venezuelans living abroad increased to an estimated 1.6 million in 2017 from 700,000 in 2015. \nThey have been driven out by Venezuela's severe economic crisis which has led to shortages of food and medicine and the world's highest inflation rate.\nThose leaving speak of the struggle to feed their families and growing levels of child malnutrition which have hit 70% in some rural areas.\nCopyright 2023 BBC.

REUTERS\/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria\/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights\nCARACAS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition election commission said on Monday it will move forward with its late October primary vote to pick its presidential candidate for next year's general election, after the country's national electoral council sought a delay.\nThe South American nation's beleaguered political opposition will face off against President Nicolas Maduro's ruling socialists, who have presided over a prolonged economic meltdown marked by sky-high inflation and persecution of critics, according to rights groups.\nMaduro is expected to run for re-election, but has not yet made a formal announcement.\nLast month, the National Electoral Council (CNE) - seen by the opposition as aligned with Maduro - responded to a June request to assist with the opposition's primary, saying it could provide voting centers and machines but stressing more time was needed to help organize the primary vote for later in November.\nBut most of the 13 opposition candidates rejected this request, preferring to keep the Oct. 22 primary, while criticizing what they called a slow CNE response.\nThe opposition commission - made up of eight lawyers and experts - said it had asked for up to 400 additional voting centers as well as security at the centers and help facilitating visas for electoral experts and foreign journalists covering the process.\nIn its own statement later on Monday, the CNE insisted it holds \"exclusive competency\" to organize elections but would provide technical support to the opposition \"to guarantee a reliable, transparent process\" that promotes participation and security.\nThe statement did not address the primary election's date.\nVenezuela's opposition counts some 3,000 voting centers, according to commission president Jesus Maria Casal.\nSome 14,000 Venezuelan schools typically serve as electoral centers for the country's 20 million voters, but since the primary is being carried out independently, these cannot be used without CNE authorization.\nVenezuelan authorities have in recent months disqualified some opposition candidates, including former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado, the opposition's leading hopeful in polls.\nReporting by Vivian Sequera and Mayela Armas; Writing by Sarah Morland; Editing by David Alire Garcia and Editing by Sonali Paul\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nThomson Reuters\nVivian reports on politics and general news from Venezuela's capital, Caracas.

Acquire Licensing Rights Read more\nCARACAS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado is leading the vote count in the Venezuelan opposition's presidential primary by a huge margin and has claimed victory in the Sunday contest, with final results pending.\nThe vote to choose a unity opposition candidate to face President Nicolas Maduro in his probable re-election bid next year came amid pledges by the United States to roll back sanctions relief if the government fails to lift bans preventing some opposition figures from holding office.\nMachado was tallying 93% of the vote, with just over 26% of ballot boxes counted, the primary's organizing commission said around midnight.\n\"From tonight we begin a great movement for a great national alliance for the transformation of Venezuela,\" Machado said at her campaign headquarters.\n\"Today I received a mandate and I accept with Venezuelans the commitment of making that mandate matter.\"\nThe count - delayed by a server blockage - was expected to resume later on Monday. It was unclear when the next results update would be given.\nMachado's nearest rival, former lawmaker Carlos Prosperi, had 4.75% of the vote.\nParticipation in the vote, organized without state help, was more than double what had been expected in some states. Venezuela has about 20 million eligible voters.\nPolling places - including in private homes and on street corners - were meant to close at 4 p.m. (2000 GMT), but many remained opened hours later, so those waiting in long lines could vote or so additional ballots could be delivered.\nSome of the estimated 3,000 polling locations nationwide had to be moved, according to human rights groups and voters, causing confusion.\nVoters also faced transportation problems. Gasoline availability was limited in border states Tachira and Bolivar and public transport in the country's interior was working irregularly, according to Reuters witnesses.\n\"On Friday we waited in three lines to be able to get gasoline for today and we couldn't,\" said housewife Melissa Diaz, 39, who arrived at her polling place in eastern Guyana City with a nearly empty tank.\n\"We've lost a whole day, but even if we had to walk or cycle, we were coming to vote.\"\nMachado, 56, an industrial engineer, has led her rivals by some 40 points in polls.\nBut Machado, like two former rivals who dropped out of the race, is barred from public office over her support of the sanctions on Maduro's government and would not be able to register for the general election.\nThe opposition and government this week signed a deal on some election guarantees, including the presence of international observers. The accord allows each side to choose its candidate according to internal rules, but did not retract the election disqualifications.\nThe United States, which broadly eased Trump-era sanctions on Venezuelan oil and gas and bonds in response to the deal, has said Maduro has until the end of November to begin rescinding the bans and releasing political prisoners and \"wrongfully detained\" Americans.\nThough five people were released, lead government negotiator Jorge Rodriguez confirmed this week that those with disqualifications cannot run in the 2024 contest, set for the second half of the year.\nSome in the opposition have said they are skeptical Maduro will follow through on the deal.\nThe opposition, which says the disqualifications are unlawful, has been reticent to say what it would do if Machado wins the primary but is unable to compete in 2024.\nMachado - who says her goal is to remove Maduro in a fair and peaceful vote - has said she would pressure the electoral authorities to let her register. Maduro has not announced that he will seek re-election, but many observers expect him to run.\nOthers have argued selecting a substitute candidate would be necessary, although whether the often-fractious opposition would accept Machado choosing a replacement remains to be seen.\nTen candidates are competing in the primary, where candidates have pledged to come up with solutions for the country's long economic crisis.\n\"If you buy diapers you don't buy food, so I buy food and not diapers,\" said 20-year-old hairdresser Rosimar Gonzalez, who voted in central Maracay with her young son in her arms.\n\"We have to change presidents.\"\nAbout 4 million of the 7.7 million Venezuelans migrants who have left their country are estimated to be of voting age and are able to vote at centers in 28 countries.\n\"I came to vote because I want to hug my grandchildren again, because I want to see my country on the road to freedom before I go,\" said a teary Armando Cedeno, 100, who voted in the afternoon in Maracaibo.\n\"I am confident that God will give me that gift.\"\n(This story has been corrected to say the vote count will resume on Monday in paragraph 6)\nReporting by Mayela Armas and Vivian Sequera in Caracas; Additional reporting by Mariela Nava in Maracaibo, Maria Ramirez in Puerto Ordaz, Mircely Guanipa in Maracay, Tibisay Romero in Valencia and Anggy Polanco in San Cristobal; Writing by Julia Symmes Cobb; Editing by Rod Nickel, Andrea Ricci, Josie Kao and Tom Hogue\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nThomson Reuters\nSince 2018 Mayela has reported for Reuters on Venezuela\u2019s economy and general news from capital Caracas.

REUTERS\/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria\/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights\n\"We urge Nicolas Maduro and his representatives to uphold the commitments they made at the signing of the political roadmap agreement,\" a State Department spokesperson said. \"The U.S. government will take action if Maduro and his representatives do not meet their commitments.\"\nBoth the investigation and the ruling come at the request of lawmaker Jose Brito, who the court said wanted to participate in the primary.\nBrito does not belong to any of the parties that took part.\n\"Following the request of preventative protection and in consequence, all the effects of the distinct phases of the electoral process conducted by the National Primary Commission are suspended,\" the tribunal said on its website.\nThe commission must present all documents related to its creation, candidate registration, voting records and other documents, the tribunal said.\nThe commission must also account for the participation of candidates like Machado, who is barred from holding public office in a decision the opposition says is illegal.\nThe ruling \"temporarily suspends the primary until there is a final decision from the tribunal,\" said lawyer and university professor Jose Vicente Haro. \"The tribunal is late to the decision because it comes after the primary. They shouldn't have accepted the petition.\"\nSome observers said the opposition parties that participated in the primary should simply recognize Machado once again as their unity candidate, making any ruling on the contest moot.\nThe opposition this month declined electoral authorities' offer of help organize the primary, and its request to delay the vote until November, after the authorities took several months to respond to the opposition's request for assistance.\nReporting by Mayela Armas and Vivian Sequera in Caracas; additional reporting by Matt Spetalnick in Washington; writing by Julia Symmes Cobb; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Bill Berkrot\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nThomson Reuters\nSince 2018 Mayela has reported for Reuters on Venezuela\u2019s economy and general news from capital Caracas.

Or just a peaceful protest gone awry? As a battle of politics becomes a battle for words to describe what happened in the capital and on Capitol Hill on January 6, 2021, Christopher Booker speaks to Joanne Freeman, a history professor at Yale University about why words used to describe the event today will shape its history.\nHari Sreenivasan:\nThere have been many discussions this week over the language used to describe the events in the capital and at the Capitol building this week.\nNewsHour Weekend's Christopher Booker has more.\nChristopher Booker:\nIts hard to find the words to describe what happened on Wednesday.\nWas it a riot? Was it an insurrection? It certainly was much more than a protest.\nIt's often said journalism is the first rough draft of history\u2026 But what impact will the words we are using have on the way America remembers what happened in Washington this week?\nJoanne Freeman:\nEven just to describe the attack on the Capitol, know are they rioters or was it a mob? Is it terrorism? Is it insurrection? Is it a coup?\nChristopher Booker:\nJoanne Freeman is a professor of history at Yale University who specializes in the politics and political culture of the revolutionary and early national periods of American history. She has written extensively about turmoil in American politics.\nJoanne Freeman:\nOne of the striking things about words right now is that in many ways, I think Americans don't quite have the words to describe what's going on.\nThis morning, I saw some people referring to what happened on Wednesday as the storming of the Capitol. And I actually object to that because storming romanticizes it, there's nothing romantic about what happened. It's not just born of passions, noble passions. It was an act with implications and repercussions. It was an attack on the government. Some people with violence in mind, it was an attack on a symbol of government that has a deep impact and above and beyond the fact that it forced members of Congress to flee in all of these ways. It's not just a peaceful expression of passion.\nChristopher Booker:\nYet 'passion' is a word often used.\nTed Cruz:\nWe gather together at a moment of division, at a moment of great passion.\nChristopher Booker:\nSenator Ted Cruz reaching for it on the Senate floor as he lodged objections to the state vote certifications on Wednesday.\nJoanne Freeman:\nSpeaking as a historian who's always interested in the meaning of words in the past, in the right context, we're in one of those moments that 50 years from now, historians will look at us grappling to find the right language to talk about this moment.\nNow, the other thing about language in this moment, you know, fascism, socialism, communism, even democracy, liberty, freedom, patriotism.\nDonald Trump:\nLooking out at all the amazing patriots here today, I have never been more confident in our nation's future.\nJoanne Freeman We're in a battle of words as well as a battle of politics, particularly  when you have extreme circumstances like we're experiencing right now, those kinds of words can be used as masks to mask extremism: This is democracy! This is liberty, this is freedom!\nNow, here's the thing, and it's going to sound obvious, but I think it's important to realize in a democratic form of government, a democracy is grounded on public sentiment and public opinion. That's really basically where the power is. A pronouncement made from on high, meaning the national stage, a congressman, a president. Those words have added meaning and those words can be taken and are almost always taken seriously by some of the public.\nChristopher Booker:\nIt's interesting because they the words and the way the words are being used are also being used, I assume, to recruit more among the far-right. For instance, I'm thinking of tweets that we saw Instagram postings of revolutionaries inside the capital, patriots taking back the people's house.\nJoanne Freeman:\nRight. Revolutionaries, people are grabbing at moments in the past out of context and using them to frame what they're doing right. This is supremely American. Our revolutionaries did it. We are just like them. That's what we're doing.\nAnd on the surface, you can happily sort of nod along with that. If you actually look at the reality of what happened during the revolution, what happened now and what these people are doing, no, that's not an easy comparison to make and the problem with that and this is the problem of propaganda.\nHow do you, how do you disprove that? Right. How do you I can say people who attack the Capitol aren't patriots. That's unpatriotic. How what do I say? If someone says, no, I feel very patriotic, I'm defending government as I see it, that's a hard these words are powerful for a reason because they're hard to refute. They're fuzzy and they have a gut impact and a profound political meaning.\nNow that leads to another point, which is, there has to be accountability in a broad way right now, because if there isn't, the message is clearly, well, that was fine, that was OK. And why if you were someone who engaged in that kind of behavior and there's no impact of any kind and there's no consequences, why would you not do that again?\n\n\nWatch the Full Episode\nJan 09\nBy PBS NewsHour\nJan 09\nBy Hari Sreenivasan, Sam Weber\n\n\nChristopher Booker\n\n\n                    Christopher Booker\n                \n\nChristopher Booker is a correspondent and producer for PBS NewsHour Weekend covering music, culture, our changing economy and news of the cool and weird.

A previous version originally published Jan. 6.\nFormer President Donald Trump faces his second impeachment trial in the Senate, charged with inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The House of Representatives impeached Trump on the charges last month and oral arguments in the trial are scheduled to begin Tuesday..\u00a0Though the article includes events beyond Jan. 6 \u2013 including Trump pressuring Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the election results\u00a0in\u00a0a recorded phone call \u2014 Trump's attorneys argue that he did not incite the crowd the day of the attack, noting that law enforcement says it was planned ahead of time.\nThe events of Jan. 6 shocked a nation watching it unfold\u00a0on Twitter and TV. A\u00a0pro-Trump mob battled police, broke into the U.S. Capitol, and sent members of Congress fleeing as lawmakers were counting Electoral College votes to confirm the presidential victory of Democrat Joe Biden. Now, five people are dead, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer.\nMany of the rioters came directly from President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cSave America Rally\u201d that began hours earlier on the Ellipse, a park near the White House. Trump spoke to them for more than an hour, insisting that the election had been stolen.\n\u201cOur country has had enough,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will not take it anymore, and that\u2019s what this is all about. To use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with, we will stop the steal.\u201d When he was finished, supporters headed for the Capitol building.\nHere is how events unfolded. Times are estimates.\nCrowds of Trump supporters, estimated in the thousands, prepare for a pro-Trump rally near the Ellipse. Many began\u00a0gathering the night before. Trump tweeted about the rally on Dec. 19:\u00a0\"Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\"\nTrump\u2019s \u201cSave America Rally\u201d begins first with the president's sons Eric\u00a0and Donald Trump Jr., then his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani.

Speaking to Newsnight's US correspondent David Grossman, one member of the group says: \"We're taking our country back.\" \nOne of the group has a radio. \"It was clear he was communicating - getting messages, sending messages to somebody,\" our correspondent said. \nPresident Trump begins his speech to supporters in Washington. Some 15 minutes into it, he starts urging them to converge on the Capitol. \n\"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard,\" he said. \nAs the president speaks, a crowd outside the Capitol is swelling. They begin marching towards the police barrier and get past officers. The police, outnumbered, try to contain them. \nTrump supporters wield flags and weapons. One man stands on a makeshift gallows, complete with a noose. The crowd chants: \"Fight for Trump.\" \nMinutes later, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi commences the certification process. \nMr Trump ends his speech with the words: \"We fight. We fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.\"\nShortly afterwards a Capitol police officer calls for backup. \n\"They're throwing metal poles at us,\" he says. \"Multiple law-enforcement injuries,\" he adds in a panicked voice. \nCapitol police send an evacuation warning. \nProtesters surge past Capitol police protecting the west steps, the side facing the White House. \nMinutes later, an officer declares there is a riot at the Capitol.  \"We're going to give riot warnings,\" he says. \"We're going to try to get compliance but this is now effectively a riot.\"\nMeanwhile Vice President Mike Pence is continuing to preside over the session. \nSecret Service quickly and suddenly evacuate Mr Pence from the Senate floor. \nThe protesters break through the windows. They push inside, hopping through the broken glass. They then kick open the doors to let others in. Some wear hoods and helmets, some hold cameras or Confederate flags.\nAn immediate recess of the Senate is called. \nA minute later, Officer Eugene Goodman runs to respond to the initial breach. He warns Senator Mitt Romney that the mob is approaching. Mr Romney turns and runs through a capitol hallway to safety. \nThe mob, a floor below them, has already begun to search for the Senate chamber. \nOfficer Goodman makes his way down to the first floor where he encounters the mob. \nHe lures the armed rioters away from the upper chamber. Many of these individuals have been calling for Mr Pence to be hanged.\nBy that point, the rioters are \"within 100ft\" (30m) of Mr Pence and a foot away from one of the doors to the chamber. Many senators are still inside. \nAt the same time, Ms Pelosi is rushed from the house floor. She is evacuated entirely from the Capitol complex to a secure off-site location. \nHer staff barricade themselves into a conference room, hiding under a table. \nStaff members of the House leader speak softly, frantically, to each other. Just outside, rioters are spreading out across the building, searching for Ms Pelosi herself.\nThe rioters chant: \"Where are you Nancy?\" In an audio clip, we hear one staff member whisper: \"They're pounding on doors trying to find her.\"\nOne man breaks open the outer door to the office where the staff are hiding, but not the inner door. Another tries as well, but eventually moves on.\nPresident Trump tweets about Mr Pence. \nAt the same time, Mr Pence is evacuated to a secure location. \nRioters start to spread through the buildings. Others break in from outside through various doors around the building. \nThey open the east side door of the rotunda to let more people in, flooding through the doors and overwhelming the officers. \nThe House floor debate is suspended to update members. House members are told to reach for tear gas masks and be prepared to use them. \nThe House is called back into session in the hope of continuing the count. \nBut minutes later the House is abruptly recessed. Members are told to get down under their chairs if necessary. \n\"Folks have entered the rotunda and are coming this way,\" lawmakers are told. \nDemocratic Congressman Eric Swalwell sends a text to his wife: \"I love you and the babies. Please hug them for me\". \nThe mob outside the chamber grows larger and they get within feet of the house door. \nPresident Trump called Senator Mike Lee, according to the Utah Republican who has provided the trial lawyers with a copy of a log from his mobile phone.\nAccording to his office, he received a call from the White House switchboard number - and the call lasted four minutes. Mr Lee has said that apparently the call was meant for Alabama senator Tommy Tuberville, and that he handed his phone to his colleague.\nMr Tuberville told reporters that he informed Mr Trump that Mr Pence had been evacuated from the Senate floor. \"I said: Mr President, they've taken the vice-president out. They want me to get off the phone, I gotta go.\"\nHouse impeachment managers say it is further evidence that the president knew how much danger his vice-president was in.\nAshli Babbit is seen turning the corner towards the House lobby doors as members are leaving.\nHouse Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern is spotted by the mob as he leaves the House floor. \nIn a hallway outside the House chamber, a group attempts to force its way through a set of locked doors. The glass window panes on the doors are shattered. A rioter uses a baton to smash through as the crowd around him chants \"break it down, break it down\".\nFootage shows the hands of an officer on the other side, holding a gun and pointing it toward the mob. We hear a shot and see Babbitt fall to the ground. \nPeople still inside the gallery of the chamber are trapped. They tell each other to take off their congressional pins. \nIn the meantime, a number of rioters reach the inside of the Senate gallery. \n\"Is this the Senate?\" one demands to know. \"Where are they?\" another asks, apparently referring to the evacuated senators.\nVideo footage shows some rioters rifling through papers and materials left behind by lawmakers. \"There's got to be something we can use against these scumbags,\" one says.\nTrump tweets asking for people to \"remain peaceful\". \nMeanwhile the mob are still at the Capitol. \nFootage shows a sprawling mob, a sea of people on the Capitol grounds. A Confederate flag waves in the foreground.\nTrump releases a video in which he tells the mob to go home. \nFifteen minutes after police confirm Ashli Babbitt has died, Trump tweets again. \nHe refers to those at the Capitol as \"great patriots\". \nThe Netflix reality series, inspired by the Korean dystopian show, saw 456 people compete for over \u00a33m.\nSecurity aid is in jeopardy as US Republicans insist on new US-Mexico border security measures.\nThe tech entrepreneur attacked rivals Nikki Haley and Chris Christie during the debate on Wednesday.\nChris Christie accused his Republican rival of avoiding a question about former president Donald Trump.\nThe move comes after eight service members died in a crash off the coast of Japan last week.\nCopyright 2023 BBC.

His comments are a key part of the impeachment trial against him.\n                \n                    \n                    Brendan Smialowski\/AFP via Getty Images\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nThen-President Donald Trump speaks to supporters from the Ellipse, near the White House, on Jan. 6 ahead of that day's insurrection at the Capitol. His comments are a key part of the impeachment trial against him.\nFormer President Donald Trump's remarks on the Ellipse on Jan. 6, urging his supporters to march on the Capitol as Congress was certifying the results of November's presidential election, are a key part of the case against Trump being made by House impeachment managers and are also being used by the lawyers who are defending him.\nThe House managers in Trump's Senate impeachment trial have already shown clips from the speech, in which Trump outlined a long list of grievances against the news media and against Republicans he deemed were insufficiently supportive, as well as a litany of false claims about how the election had been stolen from him.\nDemocrats have pointed to one phrase in particular as they argue that Trump incited those present to march down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol. \n\"We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,\" he said.\nHis defense lawyers, however, point to a different passage, in which Trump said, \"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\" They argue that his words were not a call for actual violence and lawlessness. \nRead Trump's remarks in full below, as published by The Associated Press. Editor's note: The video contains profanity.\nWell, thank you very much. This is incredible.\nMedia will not show the magnitude of this crowd. Even I, when I turned on today, I looked, and I saw thousands of people here. But you don't see hundreds of thousands of people behind you because they don't want to show that.\nWe have hundreds of thousands of people here and I just want them to be recognized by the fake news media. Turn your cameras please and show what's really happening out here because these people are not going to take it any longer. They're not going to take it any longer. Go ahead. Turn your cameras, please. Would you show? They came from all over the world, actually, but they came from all over our country.\nI just really want to see what they do. I just want to see how they covered. I've never seen anything like it. But it would be really great if we could be covered fairly by the media. The media is the biggest problem we have as far as I'm concerned, single biggest problem. The fake news and the Big tech.\nBig tech is now coming into their own. We beat them four years ago. We surprised them. We took them by surprise and this year they rigged an election. They rigged it like they've never rigged an election before. And by the way, last night they didn't do a bad job either if you notice.\nI'm honest. And I just, again, I want to thank you. It's just a great honor to have this kind of crowd and to be before you and hundreds of thousands of American patriots who are committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity of our glorious republic.\nAll of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats, which is what they're doing. And stolen by the fake news media. That's what they've done and what they're doing. We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved.\nOur country has had enough. We will not take it anymore and that's what this is all about. And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with: We will stop the steal. Today I will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election and we won it by a landslide. This was not a close election.\nYou know, I say, sometimes jokingly, but there's no joke about it: I've been in two elections. I won them both and the second one, I won much bigger than the first. OK. Almost 75 million people voted for our campaign, the most of any incumbent president by far in the history of our country, 12 million more people than four years ago.\nAnd I was told by the real pollsters \u2014 we do have real pollsters \u2014 they know that we were going to do well and we were going to win. What I was told, if I went from 63 million, which we had four years ago, to 66 million, there was no chance of losing. Well, we didn't go to 66, we went to 75 million, and they say we lost. We didn't lose.\nAnd by the way, does anybody believe that Joe had 80 million votes? Does anybody believe that? He had 80 million computer votes. It's a disgrace. There's never been anything like that. You could take third-world countries. Just take a look. Take third-world countries. Their elections are more honest than what we've been going through in this country. It's a disgrace. It's a disgrace.\nEven when you look at last night. They're all running around like chickens with their heads cut off with boxes. Nobody knows what the hell is going on. There's never been anything like this.\nWe will not let them silence your voices. We're not going to let it happen, I'm not going to let it happen.\n(Audience chants: \"Fight for Trump.\")\nThank you.\nAnd I'd love to have if those tens of thousands of people would be allowed. The military, the secret service. And we want to thank you and the police law enforcement. Great. You're doing a great job. But I'd love it if they could be allowed to come up here with us. Is that possible? Can you just let him come up, please?\nAnd Rudy, you did a great job. He's got guts. You know what? He's got guts, unlike a lot of people in the Republican Party. He's got guts. He fights, he fights.\nAnd I'll tell you. Thank you very much, John. Fantastic job. I watched. That's a tough act to follow, those two. John is one of the most brilliant lawyers in the country, and he looked at this and he said, \"What an absolute disgrace that this can be happening to our Constitution.\"\nAnd he looked at Mike Pence, and I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so.\nBecause if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election. All he has to do, all this is, this is from the number one, or certainly one of the top, Constitutional lawyers in our country. He has the absolute right to do it. We're supposed to protect our country, support our country, support our Constitution, and protect our constitution.\nStates want to revote. The states got defrauded. They were given false information. They voted on it. Now they want to recertify. They want it back. All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify and we become president and you are the happiest people.\nAnd I actually, I just spoke to Mike. I said: \"Mike, that doesn't take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage.\" And then we're stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot and we have to live with that for four more years. We're just not going to let that happen.\nMany of you have traveled from all across the nation to be here, and I want to thank you for the extraordinary love. That's what it is. There's never been a movement like this, ever, ever. For the extraordinary love for this amazing country, and this amazing movement, thank you.\n(Audience chants: \"We love Trump.\")\nBy the way, this goes all the way back past the Washington Monument. You believe this? Look at this. That is. Unfortunately gave, they gave the press the prime seats. I can't stand that.\nNo. But you look at that behind. I wish they'd flip those cameras and look behind you. That is the most amazing sight. When they make a mistake, you get to see it on television. Amazing. Amazing. All the way back.\nAnd don't worry, we will not take the name off the Washington Monument. We will not cancel culture.\nYou know they wanted to get rid of the Jefferson Memorial. Either take it down or just put somebody else in there. I don't think that's going to happen. It damn well better not. Although, with this administration, if this happens, it could happen. You'll see some really bad things happen.\nThey'll knock out Lincoln too, by the way. They've been taking his statue down. But then we signed a little law. You hurt our monuments, you hurt our heroes, you go to jail for 10 years, and everything stopped. You notice that? It stopped. It all stopped.\nAnd they could use Rudy back in New York City. Rudy. They could use you. Your city's going to hell. They want Rudy Giuliani back in New York. We'll get a little younger version of Rudy. Is that OK, Rudy?\nWe're gathered together in the heart of our nation's capital for one very, very basic and simple reason: To save our democracy.\nYou know most candidates on election evening and, of course, this thing goes on so long. They still don't have any idea what the votes are. We still have congressional seats under review. They have no idea. They've totally lost control. They've used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people in a proper election.\nBut you know, you know, when you see this and when you see what's happening. Number one, they all say, \"Sir, we'll never let it happen again.\" I said, \"That's good. But what about eight weeks ago?\" You know they try and get you to go.\nThey said, \"Sir, in four years, you're guaranteed.\" I said: \"I'm not interested right now. Do me a favor, go back eight weeks. I want to go back eight weeks. Let's go back eight weeks.\"\nWe want to go back and we want to get this right because we're going to have somebody in there that should not be in there and our country will be destroyed and we're not going to stand for that.\nFor years, Democrats have gotten away with election fraud and weak Republicans. And that's what they are. There's so many weak Republicans. And we have great ones. Jim Jordan and some of these guys, they're out there fighting. The House guys are fighting. But it's, it's incredible.\nMany of the Republicans, I helped them get in, I helped them get elected. I helped Mitch get elected. I helped. I could name 24 of them, let's say, I won't bore you with it. And then all of a sudden you have something like this. It's like, \"Oh gee, maybe I'll talk to the president sometime later.\" No, it's amazing.\nThey're weak Republicans, they're pathetic Republicans and that's what happens.\nIf this happened to the Democrats, there'd be hell all over the country going on. There'd be hell all over the country. But just remember this: You're stronger, you're smarter, you've got more going than anybody. And they try and demean everybody having to do with us. And you're the real people, you're the people that built this nation. You're not the people that tore down our nation.\nThe weak Republicans, and that's it. I really believe it. I think I'm going to use the term, the weak Republicans. You've got a lot of them. And you got a lot of great ones. But you got a lot of weak ones. They've turned a blind eye, even as Democrats enacted policies that chipped away our jobs, weakened our military, threw open our borders and put America last.\nDid you see the other day where Joe Biden said, I want to get rid of the America First policy? What's that all about? Get rid of. How do you say I want to get rid of America First? Even if you're going to do it, don't talk about it, right? Unbelievable what we have to go through. What we have to go through.\nAnd you have to get your people to fight. And if they don't fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don't fight. You primary them. We're going to. We're going to let you know who they are. I can already tell you, frankly.\nBut this year, using the pretext of the China virus and the scam of mail-in ballots, Democrats attempted the most brazen and outrageous election theft and there's never been anything like this. So pure theft in American history. Everybody knows it.\nThat election, our election was over at 10 o'clock in the evening. We're leading Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, by hundreds of thousands of votes.\nAnd then late in the evening, or early in the morning, boom, these explosions of bull****.\nAnd all of a sudden. All of a sudden it started to happen.\n(Audience chants: \"Bull****.\")\nDon't forget when Romney got beat. Romney, hey. Did you see his? I wonder if he enjoyed his flight in last night. But when Romney got beaten, you know, he stands up like you're more typical, \"Well, I'd like to congratulate the victor.\" The victor? Who is the victor, Mitt? \"I'd like to congratulate.\" They don't go and look at the facts. No, I don't know. He got, he got slaughtered. Probably, maybe it was OK, maybe it was. But that's what happened.\nBut we look at the facts and our election was so corrupt that in the history of this country we've never seen anything like it. You can go all the way back.\nYou know, America is blessed with elections. All over the world they talk about our elections. You know what the world says about us now? They said, we don't have free and fair elections.\nAnd you know what else? We don't have a free and fair press. Our media is not free, it's not fair. It suppresses thought, it suppresses speech and it's become the enemy of the people. It's become the enemy of the people. It's the biggest problem we have in this country.\nNo third-world countries would even attempt to do what we caught them doing. And you'll hear about that in just a few minutes.\nRepublicans are, Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It's like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we're going to have to fight much harder.\nAnd Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn't, that will be a, a sad day for our country because you're sworn to uphold our Constitution.\nNow, it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we're going to walk down, and I'll be there with you, we're going to walk down, we're going to walk down.\nAnyone you want, but I think right here, we're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.\nBecause you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated.\nI know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.\nToday we will see whether Republicans stand strong for integrity of our elections. But whether or not they stand strong for our country, our country. Our country has been under siege for a long time. Far longer than this four-year period. We've set it on a much greater course. So much, and we, I thought, you know, four more years. I thought it would be easy.\nWe've created the greatest economy in history. We rebuilt our military. We get you the biggest tax cuts in history. Right? We got you the biggest regulation cuts. There's no president, whether it's four years, eight years or in one case more, got anywhere near the regulation cuts.\nUsed to take 20 years to get a highway approved, now we're down to two. I want to get it down to one, but we're down to two. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we got it down to safety.\nWe created Space Force, We, we, we. Look at what we did. Our military has been totally rebuilt. So we create Space Force which, by and of itself, is a major achievement for an administration. And with us it's one of so many different things.\nRight to Try. Everybody know about Right to Try. We did things that nobody ever thought possible. We took care of our vets, our vets. The VA now has the highest rating, 91%. The highest rating that it's had from the beginning, 91% approval rating. Always, you watch the VA, it was on television every night, people living in a horrible, horrible manner. We got that done. We got accountability done. We got it so that now in the VA, you don't have to wait for four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks, four months to see a doctor. If you can't get a doctor, you go outside, you get the doctor. You have it taken care of and we pay the doctor.\nAnd we've not only made life wonderful for so many people, we've saved tremendous amounts of money, far secondarily, but we've saved a lot of money. And now we have the right to fire bad people in the VA. We had 9,000 people that treated our veterans horribly. In primetime, they would not have treated our veterans badly. But they treated our veterans horribly.\nAnd we have what's called the account, VA Accountability Act. And the accountability says if we see somebody in there that doesn't treat our vets well or they steal, they rob, they do things badly, we say: \"Joe you're fired. Get out of here.\" Before you couldn't do that. You couldn't do that before.\nSo we've taken care of things, we've done things like nobody's ever thought possible. And that's part of the reason that many people don't like us, because we've done too much.\nBut we've done it quickly and we were going to sit home and watch a big victory and everybody had us down for a victory. It was going to be great and now we're out here fighting. I said to somebody, I was going to take a few days and relax after our big electoral victory. 10 o'clock it was over. But I was going to take a few days.\nAnd I can say this. Since our election, I believe, which was such a catastrophe, when I watch. And even these guys knew what happened. They know what happened. They're saying: \"Wow, Pennsylvania's insurmountable. Wow, Wisconsin.\" Look at the big leads we had, right. Even though the press said we would lose Wisconsin by 17 points. Even though the press said, Ohio's going to be close, we set a record; Florida's going to be close, we set a record; Texas is going to be close, Texas is going to be close, we set a record.\nAnd we set a record with Hispanic, with the Black community, we set a record with everybody.\nToday we see a very important event though. Because right over there, right there, we see the event going to take place. And I'm going to be watching. Because history is going to be made. We're going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders, or whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves throughout history, throughout eternity they'll be ashamed.\nAnd you know what? If they do the wrong thing, we should never, ever forget that they did. Never forget. We should never ever forget.\nWith only three of the seven states in question, we win the presidency of the United States. And by the way, it's much more important today than it was 24 hours ago, because I don't. I spoke to David Perdue, what a great person, and Kelly Loeffler, two great people, but it was a setup.\nAnd you know, I said, \"We have no backline anymore.\" The only backline, the only line of demarcation, the only line that we have is the veto of the president of the United States. So this is now, what we're doing, a far more important election than it was two days ago.\nI want to thank the more than 140 members of the House. Those are warriors. They're over there working like you've never seen before. Studying, talking, actually going all the way back, studying the roots of the Constitution, because they know we have the right to send a bad vote that was illegally gotten.\nThey gave these people bad things to vote for and they voted because what did they know? And then when they found out a few weeks later, again, it took them four years to devise this screen.\nAnd the only unhappy person in the United States, single most unhappy, is Hillary Clinton. Because she said: \"Why didn't you do this for me four years ago? Why didn't you do this for me four years ago? Change the votes, 10,000 in Michigan. You could have changed the whole thing.\" But she's not too happy. You know, you don't see her anymore. What happened? Where's Hillary? Where is she?\nBut I want to thank all of those congressmen and women. I also want to thank our 13, most courageous members of the U.S. Senate. Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Josh Hawley, Kelly Loeffler.\nAnd Kelly Loeffler, I'll tell you, she has been, she's been so great. She worked so hard. So let's give her and David a little special hand because it was rigged against them. Let's give her and David.\nKelly Loeffler, David Purdue. They fought a good race. They never had a shot. That equipment should never have been allowed to be used, and I was telling these people don't let him use this stuff.\nMarsha Blackburn, terrific person. Mike Braun, Indiana. Steve Daines, great guy. Bill Hagerty, John Kennedy, James Lankford, Cynthia Lummis, Tommy Tuberville, the coach, and Roger Marshall. We want to thank them. Senators that stepped up, we want to thank them.\nI actually think though, it takes, again, more courage not to step up, and I think a lot of those people are going to find that out and you better start looking at your leadership, because your leadership has led you down the tubes.\nYou know, we don't want to give $2,000 to people. We want to give them $600. Oh, great. How does that play politically? Pretty good? And this has nothing to do with politics, but how does it play politically?\nChina destroyed these people. We didn't destroy. China destroy them, totally destroyed them. We want to give them $600 and they just wouldn't change.\nI said give them $2,000, we'll pay it back. We'll pay it back fast. You already owe 26 trillion, give them a couple of bucks. Let them live. Give them a couple of bucks. And some of the people here disagree with me on that, but I just say, \"Look, you've got to let people live.\"\nAnd how does that play though? OK. Number one, it's the right thing to do. But how does that play politically? I think it's the primary reason, one of the primary reasons, the other was just pure cheating. That was the primary, super primary reason. But you can't do that, you got to use your head.\nAs you know, the media has constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Have you ever seen these people? While there is no evidence of fraud. Oh, really? Well, I'm going to read you pages. I hope you don't get bored listening to it. Promise? Don't get bored listening to it, all those hundreds of thousands of people back there. Move them up, please, yeah.\nAll they, all these people, don't get bored, don't get angry at me because you're going to get bored because it's so much.\nThe American people do not believe the corrupt, fake news anymore. They have ruined their reputation. But you know, it used to be that they'd argue with me. I'd fight. So I'd fight, they'd fight, I'd fight, they'd fight. Pop pop. You'd believe me, you'd believe them. Somebody comes out. You know, they had their point of view, I had my point of view, but you'd have an argument.\nNow what they do is they go silent. It's called suppression and that's what happens in a communist country. That's what they do, they suppress. You don't fight with them anymore. Unless it's a bad story. They have a little bad story about me, they make it 10 times worse and it's a major headline.\nBut Hunter Biden, they don't talk about him. What happened to Hunter? Where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? They don't talk about him. They'll watch, all the sets will go off. Well, they can't do that because they get good ratings. Their ratings are too good. Now, where's Hunter? You know.\nAnd how come Joe is allowed to give a billion dollars of money to get rid of the prosecutor in Ukraine? How does that happen? I'd ask you that question. How does that happen? Can you imagine if I said that? If I said that it would be a whole different ballgame.\nAnd how come Hunter gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife, and gets hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on an energy board, even though he admits he has no knowledge of energy? And millions of dollars up front.\nAnd how come they go into China and they leave with billions of dollars to manage. \"Have you managed money before?\" \"No, I haven't.\" \"Oh, that's good. Here's about 3 billion.\" No, they don't talk about that.\nNo, we have a corrupt media. They've gone silent. They've gone dead. I now realize how good it was if you go back 10 years, I realized how good, even though I didn't necessarily love them, I realized how good. It was like a cleansing motion, right?\nBut we don't have that anymore. We don't have a fair media anymore. It's suppression. And you have to be very careful with that and they've lost all credibility in this country.\nWe will not be intimidated into accepting the hoaxes and the lies that we've been forced to believe.\nOver the past several weeks, we've amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election. This is the presidential election. Last night was a little bit better because of the fact that we had a lot of eyes watching one specific state, but they cheated like hell anyway.\nYou have one of the dumbest governors in the United States. And you know when I endorsed him, and I didn't know this guy, at the request of David Perdue, he said, \"Friend of mine's running for governor.\" \"What's his name?\" And you know the rest. He was in fourth place, fifth place. I don't know, he was, he was doing poorly. I endorse him, he went like a rocket ship and he won.\nAnd then I had to beat Stacey Abrams with this guy, Brian Kemp. I had to beat Stacey Abrams. And I had to beat Oprah, used to be a friend of mine. You know, I was on her last show, her last week, she picked the five outstanding people. I don't think she thinks that any more. Once I ran for president, I didn't notice there were too many calls coming in from Oprah. Believe it or not, she used to like me. But I was one of the five outstanding people.\nAnd I had a campaign against Michelle Obama and Barack Hussein Obama, against Stacey.\nAnd I had Brian Kemp, who weighs 130 pounds. He said he played offensive line in football. I'm trying to figure that out. I'm still trying to figure that out. He said that the other night, \"I was an offensive lineman.\" I'm saying: \"Really? That must have been a very small team.\" But I look at that and I look at what's happened and he turned out to be a disaster. This stuff happens.\nYou know, look, I'm not happy with the Supreme Court. They love to rule against me. I picked three people. I fought like hell for them. One in particular, I fought. They all said, \"Sir, cut him loose.\" He's killing the senators. You know, very loyal senators, they're very loyal people, \"Sir, cut him loose, he's killing us, sir, cut him loose.\" I must have gotten half of the senators.\nI said: \"No, I can't do that, it's unfair to him and it's unfair to the family. He didn't do anything wrong.\" They made up stories, they're all made-up stories. He didn't do anything wrong. \"Cut him loose, sir.\" I said, \"No, I won't do that. We got him through.\" And you know what, they couldn't give a damn. They couldn't give a damn. Let him rule the right way.\nBut it almost seems that they're all going out of their way to hurt all of us and to hurt our country. To hurt our country.\nYou know, I read a story in one of the newspapers recently how I control the three Supreme Court justices. I control them. They're puppets.\nI read it about Bill Barr, that he's my personal attorney. That he'll do anything for me. And I said, \"You know, it really is genius.\" Because what they do is that, and it makes it really impossible for them to ever give you a victory, because all of a sudden Bill Barr changed. If you hadn't noticed. I like Bill Barr, but he changed, because he didn't want to be considered my personal attorney.\nAnd the Supreme Court, they rule against me so much. You know why? Because the story is \u2014 I haven't spoken to any of them, any of them, since virtually they got in \u2014 but the story is that they're my puppets. Right? That they're puppets.\nAnd now the only way they can get out of that because they hate that it's not good in the social circuit. And the only way they get out is to rule against Trump. So let's rule against Trump. And they do that. So I want to congratulate them.\nBut it shows you the media's genius. In fact, probably if I was the media, I'd do it the same way. I hate to say it. But we got to get them straightened out.\nToday, for the sake of our democracy, for the sake of our Constitution, and for the sake of our children, we lay out the case for the entire world to hear. You want to hear it?\n(Audience responds: \"Yeah\")\nIn every single swing state, local officials, state officials, almost all Democrats, made illegal and unconstitutional changes to election procedures without the mandated approvals by the state legislatures.\nThat these changes paved a way for fraud on a scale never seen before. I think we go a long way outside of our country when I say that.\nSo, just in a nutshell, you can't make a change or voting for a federal election unless the state legislature approves it. No judge can do it. Nobody can do it. Only a legislature.\nSo as an example, in Pennsylvania, or whatever, you have a Republican legislature, you have a Democrat mayor, and you have a lot of Democrats all over the place. They go to the legislature. The legislature laughs at them, says we're not going to do that. They say, thank you very much and they go and make the changes themselves, they do it anyway. And that's totally illegal. That's totally illegal. You can't do that.\nIn Pennsylvania, the Democrat secretary of state and the Democrat state Supreme Court justices illegally abolished the signature verification requirements just 11 days prior to the election.\nSo think of what they did. No longer is there signature verification. Oh, that's OK. We want voter ID by the way. But no longer is there a signature verification. Eleven days before the election they say we don't want it. You know why they don't want to? Because they want to cheat. That's the only reason.\nWho would even think of that? We don't want to verify a signature?\nThere were over 205,000 more ballots counted in Pennsylvania. Think of this, you had 205,000 more ballots than you had voters. That means you had two. Where did they come from? You know where they came from? Somebody's imagination, whatever they needed.\nSo in Pennsylvania, you had 205,000 more votes than you had voters. And the number is actually much greater than that now. That was as of a week ago. And this is a mathematical impossibility unless you want to say it's a total fraud.\nSo Pennsylvania was defrauded. Over 8,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match individuals who died in 2020 and prior to the election. Think of that. Dead people, lots of dead people, thousands. And some dead people actually requested an application. That bothers me even more.\nNot only are they voting, they want an application to vote. One of them was 29 years ago, died. It's incredible. Over 14,000 ballots were cast by out-of-state voters, so these are voters that don't live in this state.\nAnd by the way, these numbers are what they call outcome-determinative, meaning these numbers far surpass. I lost by a very little bit. These numbers are massive, massive.\nMore than 10,000 votes in Pennsylvania were illegally counted, even though they were received after Election Day. In other words, they were received after Election Day. Let's count them anyway.\nAnd what they did in many cases is, they did fraud. They took the date and they moved it back so that it no longer is after Election Day. And more than 60,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were reported received back. They got back before they were ever supposedly mailed out. In other words, you got the ballot back before you mailed it, which is also logically and logistically impossible, right?\nThink of that one. You got the ballot back. Let's send the ballots. Oh, they've already been sent. But we got the ballot back before they were sent. I don't think that's too good, right?\nTwenty-five thousand ballots in Pennsylvania were requested by nursing home residents, all in a single giant batch, not legal, indicating an enormous, illegal ballot harvesting operation. You're not allowed to do it, it's against the law.\nThe day before the election, the state of Pennsylvania reported the number of absentee ballots that had been sent out. Yet this number was suddenly and drastically increased by 400,000 people. It was increased, nobody knows where it came from, by 400,000 ballots, one day after the election.\nIt remains totally unexplained. They said, \"Well, ah, we can't figure that.\" Now, that's many, many times what it would take to overthrow the state. Just that one element. Four hundred thousand ballots appeared from nowhere right after the election.\nBy the way, Pennsylvania has now seen all of this. They didn't know because it was so quick. They had a vote. They voted. But now they see all this stuff, it's all come to light. Doesn't happen that fast. And they want to recertify their votes. They want to recertify. But the only way that can happen is if Mike Pence agrees to send it back. Mike Pence has to agree to send it back.\n(Audience chants: \"Send it back.\")\nAnd many people in Congress want it sent back.\nAnd think of what you're doing. Let's say you don't do it. Somebody says, \"Well, we have to obey the Constitution.\" And you are, because you're protecting our country and you're protecting the Constitution. So you are.\nBut think of what happens. Let's say they're stiffs and they're stupid people, and they say, well, we really have no choice. Even though Pennsylvania and other states want to redo their votes. They want to see the numbers. They already have the numbers. Go very quickly. And they want to redo their legislature because many of these votes were taken, as I said, because it wasn't approved by their legislature. You know, that, in itself, is legal. And then you have the scam, and that's all of the things that we're talking about.\nBut think of this. If you don't do that, that means you will have a president of the United States for four years, with his wonderful son. You will have a president who lost all of these states. Or you will have a president, to put it another way, who was voted on by a bunch of stupid people who lost all of these states.\nYou will have an illegitimate president. That's what you'll have. And we can't let that happen.\nThese are the facts that you won't hear from the fake news media. It's all part of the suppression effort. They don't want to talk about it. They don't want to talk about it. In fact, when I started talking about that, I guarantee you, a lot of the television sets and a lot of those cameras went off. And that's a lot of cameras back there. But a lot of them went off.\nBut these are the things you don't hear about. You don't hear what you just heard. I'm going to go over a few more states. But you don't hear it by the people who want to deceive you and demoralize you and control you. Big tech, media.\nJust like the suppression polls that said we're going lose Wisconsin by 17 points. Well, we won Wisconsin. They don't have it that way because they lost just by a little sliver. But they had me down the day before, Washington Post\/ABC poll, down 17 points.\nI called up a real pollster. I said, \"What is that?\" \"Sir, that's called a suppression poll. I think you're going to win Wisconsin, sir.\"\nI said, \"But why don't they make it four or five points?\" Because then people vote. But when you're down 17, they say, \"Hey, I'm not going to waste my time. I love the president, but there's no way.\"\nDespite that, despite that, we won Wisconsin. It's going to see. I mean, you'll see. But that's called suppression because a lot of people when they see that. It's very interesting. This pollster said, \"Sir, if you're down three, four, or five people vote. When you go down 17, they say, 'Let's save. Let's go and have dinner and let's watch the presidential defeat tonight on television, darling.'\"\nAnd just like the radical left tries to blacklist you on social media. Every time I put out a tweet, that's, even if it's totally correct, totally correct, I get a flag. I get a flag.\nAnd they also don't let you get out. You know, on Twitter, it's very hard to come onto my account. It's very hard to get out a message. They don't let the message get out nearly like they should. But I've had many people say, \"I can't get on your Twitter.\" I don't care about Twitter. Twitter's bad news. They're all bad news.\nBut you know what, if you want to, if you want to get out a message and if you want to go through Big tech, social media, they are really, if you're a conservative, if you're a Republican, if you have a big voice, I guess they call it shadow banned, right? Shadow banned. They shadow ban you, and it should be illegal.\nI've been telling these Republicans, get rid of Section 230. And for some reason, Mitch and the group, they don't want to put it in there and they don't realize that that's going to be the end of the Republican Party as we know it, but it's never going to be the end of us. Never. Let them get out. Let, let the weak ones get out. This is a time for strength.\nThey also want to indoctrinate your children in school by teaching them things that aren't so. They want to indoctrinate your children. It's all part of the comprehensive assault on our democracy, and the American people are finally standing up and saying no. This crowd is, again, a testament to it.\nI did no advertising, I did nothing. You do have some groups that are big supporters. I want to thank that, Amy, and everybody. We have some incredible supporters, incredible. But we didn't do anything. This just happened. Two months ago, we had a massive crowd come down to Washington. I said, \"What are they there for?\" \"Sir, they're there for you.\"\nWe have nothing to do with it. These groups are for, they're forming all over the United States. And we got to remember, in a year from now, you're going to start working on Congress and we got to get rid of the weak Congress, people, the ones that aren't any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world. We got to get rid of them. We got to get rid.\nYou know, she never wants a soldier brought home \u2014 I brought a lot of our soldiers home. I don't know, somewhat like it. They're in countries that nobody even knows the name, nobody knows where they are. They're dying. They're great, but they're dying. They're losing their arms, their legs, their face. I brought them back home, largely back home. Afghanistan, Iraq.\nRemember, I used to say in the old days: \"Don't go in Iraq. But if you go in, keep the oil.\" We didn't keep the oil. So stupid. So stupid these people. And Iraq has billions and billions of dollars now in the bank. And what did we do? We got nothing. We never get. But we do actually, we kept the oil here or we get, we did good.\nWe got rid of the ISIS caliphate. We got rid of plenty of different things that everybody knows and the rebuilding of our military in three years. People said it couldn't be done. And it was all made in the USA, all made in the USA, best equipment in the world.\nIn Wisconsin, corrupt Democrat-run cities deployed more than 500 illegal, unmanned, unsecured drop boxes, which collected a minimum of 91,000 unlawful votes. It was razor-thin, the loss. This one thing alone is much more than we would need. But there are many things.\nThey have these lockboxes. And, you know, they'd pick them up and they disappear for two days. People would say where's that box? They disappeared. Nobody even knew where the hell it was.\nIn addition, over 170,000 absentee votes were counted in Wisconsin without a valid absentee ballot application. So they had a vote, but they had no application, and that's illegal in Wisconsin. Meaning those votes were blatantly done in opposition to state law and they came 100% from Democrat areas such as Milwaukee and Madison, 100%.\nIn Madison, 17,000 votes were deposited in so-called human drop boxes. You know what that is, right? Where operatives stuff thousands of unsecured ballots into duffle bags on park benches across the city, in complete defiance of cease-and-desist letters from state legislature.\nYour state legislatures said don't do it. They're the only ones that can approve it. They gave tens of thousands of votes. They came in in duffle bags. Where the hell did they come from?\nAccording to eyewitness testimony, Postal Service workers in Wisconsin were also instructed to illegally backdate approximately 100,000 ballots. The margin of difference in Wisconsin was less than 20,000 votes. Each one of these things alone wins us the state. Great state. We love the state. We won the state.\nIn Georgia, your secretary of state who, I can't believe this guy's a Republican. He loves recording telephone conversations. You know, that was? I thought it was a great conversation personally. So did a lot of other. People love that conversation because it says what's going on.\nThese people are crooked. They're 100%, in my opinion, one of the most corrupt, between your governor and your secretary of state. And now you have it again last night. Just take a look at what happened. What a mess.\nAnd the Democrat Party operatives entered into an illegal and unconstitution \u2014 unconstitutional settlement agreement that drastically weakened signature verification and other election security procedures.\nStacey Abrams. She took them to lunch. And I beat her two years ago with a bad candidate, Brian Kemp. But they took, the Democrats took the Republicans to lunch because the secretary of state had no clue what the hell was happening. Unless he did have a clue. That's interesting. Maybe he was with the other side.\nBut we've been trying to get verifications of signatures in Fulton County, they won't let us do it. The only reason they won't is because we'll find things in the hundreds of thousands. Why wouldn't they let us verify signatures in Fulton County, which is known for being very corrupt. They won't do it. They go to some other county where you would live.\nI said, \"That's not the problem.\" The problem is Fulton County, home of Stacey Abrams. She did a good job, I congratulate her. But it was done in such a way that we can't let this stuff happen. We won't have a country if it happens.\nAs a result, Georgia's absentee ballot rejection rate was more than 10 times lower than previous levels because the criteria was so off.\nForty-eight counties in Georgia, with thousands and thousands of votes, rejected zero ballots. There wasn't one ballot. In other words, in a year in which more mail-in ballots were sent than ever before, and more people were voting by mail for the first time, the rejection rate was drastically lower than it had ever been before.\nThe only way this can be explained is if tens of thousands of illegitimate votes were added to the tally. That's the only way you could explain it.\nBy the way, you're talking about tens of thousands. If Georgia had merely rejected the same number of unlawful ballots as in other years, they should have been approximately 45,000 ballots rejected. Far more than what we needed to win, just over 11,000. They should find those votes. They should absolutely find that. Just over 11,000 votes, that's all we need. They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia, and we're not going to forget it.\nThere's only one reason the Democrats could possibly want to eliminate signature matching, opposed voter ID, and stop citizenship confirmation. \"Are you a citizenship?\" You're not allowed to ask that question, because they want to steal the election.\nThe radical left knows exactly what they're doing. They're ruthless and it's time that somebody did something about it. And Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. And if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I'm not hearing good stories.\nIn Fulton County, Republican poll watchers were ejected, in some cases, physically from the room under the false pretense of a pipe burst. Water main burst, everybody leave. Which we now know was a total lie.\nThen election officials pull boxes, Democrats, and suitcases of ballots out from under a table. You all saw it on television, totally fraudulent. And illegally scanned them for nearly two hours, totally unsupervised. Tens of thousands of votes. This act coincided with a mysterious vote dump of up to 100,000 votes for Joe Biden, almost none for Trump. Oh, that sounds fair. That was at 1:34 a.m.\nThe Georgia secretary of state and pathetic governor of Georgia, have reached, although he says I'm a great president. You know, I sort of maybe have to change. He said the other day, \"Yes, I do. I disagree with president, but he's been a great president.\" Good, thanks. Thank you very much.\nBecause of him and others, you have Brian Kemp. Vote him the hell out of office, please. Well, his rates are so low. You know, his approval rating now, I think it just reached a record low.\nThey've rejected five separate appeals for an independent and comprehensive audit of signatures in Fulton County. Even without an audit, the number of fraudulent ballots that we've identified across the state is staggering.\nOver 10,300 ballots in Georgia were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Georgia residents who died in 2020 and prior to the election.\nMore than 2,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match incarcerated felons in Georgia prison. People who are not allowed to vote.\nMore than 4,500 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state's own voter rolls.\nOver 18,000 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant, according to the Postal Service.\nAt least 88,000 ballots in Georgia were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated.\nSixty-six thousand votes, each one of these is far more than we need. Sixty-six thousand votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.\nAnd at least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to November 3 election. They say they moved right back. They moved right back. Oh, they moved out, they moved right back. OK. They missed Georgia that much. I do. I love Georgia, but it's a corrupt system.\nDespite all of this, the margin in Georgia is only 11,779 votes.\nEach and every one of these issues is enough to give us a victory in Georgia, a big beautiful victory. Make no mistake, this election was stolen from you, from me and from the country.\nAnd not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots. This should absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified.\nIn the state of Arizona, over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens. Two thousand ballots were returned with no address. More than 22,000 ballots were returned before they were ever supposedly mailed out. They returned, but we haven't mailed them yet.\nEleven thousand six hundred more ballots and votes were counted, more than there were actual voters. You see that? So you have more votes again than you have voters.\nOne hundred and fifty thousand people registered in Maricopa County after the registration deadline. One hundred and three thousand ballots in the county were sent for electronic adjudication with no Republican observers.\nIn Clark County, Nevada, the accuracy settings on signature verification machines were purposely lowered before they were used to count over 130,000 ballots.\nIf you signed your name as Santa Claus, it would go through.\nThere were also more than 42,000 double votes in Nevada. Over 150,000 people were hurt so badly by what took place. And 1,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Nevada residents who died in 2020 prior to November 3 election. More than 8,000 votes were cast by individuals who had no address and probably didn't live there.\nThe margin in Nevada is down at a very low number, any of these things would have taken care of the situation. We would have won Nevada, also. Every one of these we're going over, we win.\nIn Michigan, quickly, the secretary of state, a real great one, flooded the state with unsolicited mail-in ballot applications sent to every person on the rolls in direct violation of state law.\nMore than 17,000 Michigan ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match people who were deceased.\nIn Wayne County, that's a great one. That's Detroit. One hundred and seventy-four thousand ballots were counted without being tied to an actual registered voter. Nobody knows where they came from.\nAlso, in Wayne County, poll watchers observed canvassers rescanning batches of ballots over and over again, up to three or four or five times.\nIn Detroit, turnout was 139% of registered voters. Think of that. So you had 139% of the people in Detroit voting. This is in Michigan. Detroit, Michigan.\nA career employee of the Detroit, City of Detroit, testified under penalty of perjury that she witnessed city workers coaching voters to vote straight Democrat while accompanying them to watch who they voted for. When a Republican came in, they wouldn't talk to him.\nThe same worker was instructed not to ask for any voter ID and not to attempt to validate any signatures if they were Democrats. She also told to illegally, and was told, backdate ballots received after the deadline and reports that thousands and thousands of ballots were improperly backdated. That's Michigan.\nFour witnesses have testified under penalty of perjury that after officials in Detroit announced the last votes had been counted, tens of thousands of additional ballots arrived without required envelopes. Every single one was for a Democrat. I got no votes.\nAt 6:31 a.m. in the early morning hours after voting had ended, Michigan suddenly reported 147,000 votes. An astounding 94% went to Joe Biden, who campaigned brilliantly from his basement. Only a couple of percentage points went to Trump.\nSuch gigantic and one-sided vote dumps were only observed in a few swing states and they were observed in the states where it was necessary.\nYou know what's interesting? President Obama beat Biden in every state other than the swing states where Biden killed them, but the swing states were the ones that mattered.\nThey're always just enough to push Joe Biden barely into the lead. We were ahead by a lot and within a number of hours we were losing by a little.\nIn addition, there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion Voting Systems. In one Michigan county alone, 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden and the same systems are used in the majority of states in our country.\nSenator William Ligon, a great gentleman, chairman of Georgia's senate judiciary subcommittee. Senator Ligon, highly respected, on elections has written a letter describing his concerns with Dominion in Georgia.\nHe wrote, and I quote, The Dominion Voting Machines employed in Fulton County had an astronomical and astounding 93.67% error rate. It's only wrong 93% of the time in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voter's interest in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of 113,000.\nThink of it. You go in and you vote and then they tell people who you supposed to be voting for. They make up whatever they want. Nobody's ever even heard.\nThey adjudicate your vote. They say, Well, we don't think Trump wants to vote for Trump. We think he wants to vote for Biden. Put it down for Biden.\nThe national average for such an error rate is far less than 1% and yet you're at 93%. The source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up or destroyed to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter.\nThe letter continues. There is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from President Trump to former Vice President Biden in several counties in Georgia.\nFor example, in Bibb County, President Trump was reported to have 29,391 votes at 9:11 p.m. Eastern time, while simultaneously Vice President Joe Biden was reported to have 17,213. Minutes later, just minutes, at the next update, these vote numbers switched with President Trump going way down to 17,000 and Biden going way up to 29,391. And that was very quick, a 12,000 vote switch all in Mr. Biden's favor.\nSo, I mean, I could go on and on about this fraud that took place in every state, and all of these legislatures want this back. I don't want to do it to you because I love you and it's freezing out here. But I could just go on forever. I can tell you this.\n(Audience chants: \"We love you.\")\nSo when you hear, when you hear, while there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing, this is the most fraudulent thing anybody has, this is a criminal enterprise. This is a criminal enterprise. And the press will say, and I'm sure they won't put any of that on there, because that's no good. And you ever see, while there is no evidence to back President Trump's assertion.\nI could go on for another hour reading this stuff to you and telling you about it. There's never been anything like it.\nThink about it. Detroit had more votes than it had voters. Pennsylvania had 205,000 more votes than it had more. But you don't have to go any. Between that, I think that's almost better than dead people if you think, right? More votes than they had voters. And many other states also.\nIt's a disgrace that the United States of America, tens of millions of people, are allowed to go vote without so much as even showing identification.\nIn no state is there any question or effort made to verify the identity, citizenship, residency or eligibility of the votes cast.\nThe Republicans have to get tougher. You're not going to have a Republican Party if you don't get tougher. They want to play so straight. They want to play so, sir, yes, the United States. The Constitution doesn't allow me to send them back to the States. Well, I say, yes it does, because the Constitution says you have to protect our country and you have to protect our Constitution, and you can't vote on fraud. And fraud breaks up everything, doesn't it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very different rules.\nSo I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do. And I hope he doesn't listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he's listening to.\nIt is also widely understood that the voter rolls are crammed full of non-citizens, felons and people who have moved out of state and individuals who are otherwise ineligible to vote. Yet Democrats oppose every effort to clean up their voter rolls. They don't want to clean them up. They're loaded.\nAnd how many people here know other people, that when there are hundreds of thousands and then millions of ballots got sent out, got three, four, five, six, and I heard one, who got seven ballots. And then they say you didn't quite make it, sir.\nWe won in a landslide. This was a landslide. They said it's not American to challenge the election. This the most corrupt election in the history, maybe of the world.\nYou know, you could go third-world countries, but I don't think they had hundreds of thousands of votes and they don't have voters for them. I mean no matter where you go, nobody would think this.\nIn fact, it's so egregious, it's so bad that a lot of people don't even believe it. It's so crazy that people don't even believe it. It can't be true. So they don't believe it.\nThis is not just a matter of domestic politics \u2014 this is a matter of national security.\nSo today, in addition to challenging the certification of the election, I'm calling on Congress and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping election reforms, and you better do it before we have no country left.\nToday is not the end, it's just the beginning.\nWith your help over the last four years, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country and nobody even challenges that.\nI say that over and over, and I never get challenged by the fakeness, and they challenge almost everything we say.\nBut our fight against the big donors, big media, big tech, and others is just getting started. This is the greatest in history. There's never been a movement like that.\nYou look back there all the way to the Washington Monument. It's hard to believe.\nWe must stop the steal and then we must ensure that such outrageous election fraud never happens again, can never be allowed to happen again.\nBut we're going forward. We'll take care of going forward. We've got to take care of going back. Don't let them talk. OK, well, we promised. I've had a lot of people. Sir, you're at 96% for four years. I said I'm not interested right now. I'm interested in right there.\nWith your help, we will finally pass powerful requirements for voter ID. You need an ID to cash a check. You need an ID to go to a bank, to buy alcohol, to drive a car. Every person should need to show an ID in order to cast your most important thing, a vote.\nWe will also require proof of American citizenship in order to vote in American elections. We just had a good victory in court on that one, actually.\nWe will ban ballot harvesting and prohibit the use of unsecured drop boxes to commit rampant fraud. These drop boxes are fraudulent. Therefore, they get disapp \u2014 they disappear, and then all of a sudden they show up. It's fraudulent.\nWe will stop the practice of universal unsolicited mail-in balloting.\nWe will clean up the voter rolls that ensure that every single person who casts a vote is a citizen of our country, a resident of the state in which they vote and their vote is cast in a lawful and honest manner.\nWe will restore the vital civic tradition of in-person voting on Election Day so that voters can be fully informed when they make their choice.\nWe will finally hold big tech accountable. And if these people had courage and guts, they would get rid of Section 230, something that no other company, no other person in America, in the world has.\nAll of these tech monopolies are going to abuse their power and interfere in our elections, and it has to be stopped. And the Republicans have to get a lot tougher, and so should the Democrats. They should be regulated, investigated, and brought to justice under the fullest extent of the law. They're totally breaking the law.\nTogether, we will drain the Washington swamp and we will clean up the corruption in our nation's capital. We have done a big job on it, but you think it's easy. It's a dirty business. It's a dirty business. You have a lot of bad people out there.\nDespite everything we've been through, looking out all over this country and seeing fantastic crowds. Although this, I think, is our all-time record. I think you have 250,000 people. 250,000.\nLooking out at all the amazing patriots here today, I have never been more confident in our nation's future. Well, I have to say, we have to be a little bit careful. That's a nice statement, but we have to be a little careful with that statement.\nIf we allow this group of people to illegally take over our country because it's illegal when the votes are illegal when the way they got there is illegal when the states that vote are given false and fraudulent information.\nWe are the greatest country on Earth and we are headed and were headed in the right direction.\nYou know, the wall is built. We're doing record numbers at the wall. Now, they want to take down the wall. Let's let everyone flow in. Let's let everybody flow in. We did a great job in the wall. Remember, the wall, they said it could never be done. One of the largest infrastructure projects we've ever had in this country, and it's had a tremendous impact, that we got rid of catch and release. We got rid of all of this stuff that we had to live with.\nBut now, the caravans, I think Biden's getting in, the caravans are forming again. They want to come in again and rip off our country. Can't let it happen.\nAs this enormous crowd shows, we have truth and justice on our side. We have a deep and enduring love for America in our hearts. We love our country.\nWe have overwhelming pride in this great country and we have it deep in our souls. Together, we are determined to defend and preserve government of the people, by the people and for the people.\nOur brightest days are before us. Our greatest achievements, still away.\nI think one of our great achievements will be election security. Because nobody until I came along had any idea how corrupt our elections were.\nAnd again, most people would stand there at 9 o'clock in the evening and say I want to thank you very much, and they go off to some other life. But I said something's wrong here, something is really wrong, can have happened.\nAnd we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\nOur exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun. My fellow Americans, for our movement, for our children, and for our beloved country.\nAnd I say this despite all that's happened. The best is yet to come.\nSo we're going to, we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. And we're going to the Capitol, and we're going to try and give.\nThe Democrats are hopeless \u2014 they never vote for anything. Not even one vote. But we're going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones because the strong ones don't need any of our help. We're going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.\nSo let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.\nI want to thank you all.

Thank you.\nSponsor Message\nBecome an NPR sponsor","11":"clockThis article was published more than\u00a02 years ago\nRelief flowed through Facebook in the days after the 2020 presidential election. The company had cracked down on misinformation, foreign interference and hate speech \u2014 and employees believed they had largely succeeded in limiting problems that, four years earlier, had brought on perhaps the most serious crisis in Facebook\u2019s scandal-plagued history.\n\u201cIt was like we could take a victory lap,\u201d said a former employee, one of many who spoke for this story on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive matters. \u201cThere was a lot of the feeling of high-fiving in the office.\u201d\nMany who had worked on the election, exhausted from months of unrelenting toil, took leaves of absence or moved on to other jobs. Facebook rolled back many of the dozens of election-season measures that it had used to suppress hateful, deceptive content. A ban the company had imposed on the original Stop the Steal group stopped short of addressing dozens of look-alikes that popped up in what an internal Facebook after-action report, first reported by BuzzFeed News, called \u201ccoordinated\u201d and \u201cmeteoric\u201d growth. Meanwhile, the company\u2019s Civic Integrity team was largely disbanded by a management that had grown weary of the team\u2019s criticisms of the company, according to former employees.\nBut the high-fives, it soon became clear, were premature.\nOn Jan. 6, Facebook staffers expressed their horror in internal messages as they watched thousands of Trump supporters shouting \u201cstop the steal\u201d and bearing the symbols of QAnon \u2014 a violent ideology that had spread widely on Facebook before an eventual crackdown \u2014 thronged the U.S. Capitol. Many bashed their way inside and battled to halt the constitutionally mandated certification of President Biden\u2019s election victory.\nHow one of America\u2019s ugliest days unraveled inside and outside the Capitol\nMeasures of online mayhem surged alarmingly on Facebook, with user reports of \u201cfalse news\u201d hitting nearly 40,000 per hour, an internal report that day showed. On Facebook-owned Instagram, the account reported most often for inciting violence was @realdonaldtrump \u2014 the president\u2019s official account, the report showed.\nFacebook has never publicly disclosed what it knows about how its platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp, helped fuel that day\u2019s mayhem. The company rejected its own Oversight Board\u2019s recommendation that it study how its policies contributed to the violence and has yet to fully comply with requests for data from the congressional commission investigating the events.\nBut thousands of pages of internal company documents disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission by the whistleblower Frances Haugen offer important new evidence of Facebook\u2019s role in the events. This story is based on those documents, as well as on others independently obtained by The Washington Post, and on interviews with current and former Facebook employees. The documents include outraged posts on Workplace, an internal message system.\n\u201cThis is not a new problem,\u201d one unnamed employee fumed on Workplace on Jan. 6. \u201cWe have been watching this behavior from politicians like Trump, and the \u2014 at best \u2014 wishy washy actions of company leadership, for years now. We have been reading the [farewell] posts from trusted, experienced and loved colleagues who write that they simply cannot conscience working for a company that does not do more to mitigate the negative effects on its platform.\u201d\nThe SEC documents, which were provided to Congress in redacted form by Haugen\u2019s legal counsel and reviewed by The Post and other news organizations, suggest that Facebook moved too quickly after the election to lift measures that had helped suppress some election-related misinformation.\nThe rushed effort to restore them on Jan. 6 was not enough to stop the surge of hateful, violent posts, documents show. A company after-action report concluded that in the weeks after the election, Facebook did not act forcefully enough against the Stop the Steal movement that was pushed by Trump\u2019s political allies, even as its presence exploded across the platform.\nThe documents also provide ample evidence that the company\u2019s internal research over several years had identified ways to diminish the spread of political polarization, conspiracy theories and incitements to violence but that in many instances, executives had declined to implement those steps.\nTrump allies, largely unconstrained by Facebook\u2019s rules against repeated falsehoods, cement pre-election dominance\nFacebook officials counter that they planned exhaustively for the election and its aftermath, even anticipating the potential for post-election violence, and always expected the challenges to last through Inauguration Day.\nThey acknowledge rolling back some protective measures in December but said they did so only when measures of problematic content had declined markedly, and that numerous other effective measures remained in place through Jan. 6 and beyond. They laid the blame for the Capitol siege on broader political forces and content that flowed more freely on other online platforms.\n\u201cThe responsibility for the violence that occurred on January 6 lies with those who attacked our Capitol and those who encouraged them,\u201d spokeswoman Dani Lever said in a statement. \u201cWe took steps to limit content that sought to delegitimize the election, including labeling candidates\u2019 posts with the latest vote count after Mr. Trump prematurely declared victory, pausing new political advertising and removing the original #StopTheSteal Group in November.\u201d\nShe added, \"After the violence at the Capitol erupted and as we saw continued attempts to organize events to dispute the outcome of the presidential election, we removed content with the phrase \u2018stop the steal\u2019 under our Coordinating Harm policy and suspended Trump from our platforms.\u201d\nBut many employees with a close-up view of the company\u2019s actions before and during Jan. 6 emerged from the experience angry and demanding answers. Both feelings were well represented in posts on Workplace and echoed in interviews with The Post.\n\u201cNever forget the day Trump rode down the escalator in 2015, called for a ban on Muslims entering the US, [and] we determined that it violated our policies, and yet we explicitly overrode the policy and didn\u2019t take the video down,\u201d one wrote bitterly. \u201cThere is a straight line that can be drawn from that day to today, one of the darkest days in the history of democracy and self-governance. Would it have made a difference in the end? We can never know, but history will not judge us kindly.\u201d\nThe documents and interviews with former employees make clear that Facebook has deep, highly precise knowledge about how its users are affected by what appears on its sites. Facebook relentlessly measures an astonishing array of data points, including the frequency, reach and sources of falsehoods and hateful content and often implements measures to suppress both.\nFacebook keeps researching its own harms \u2014 and burying the findings\nThe company exhaustively studies potential policy changes for their impacts on user growth and other factors key to corporate profits, such as engagement, the extent of sharing and other reactions. Public relations and political impacts also are carefully weighed \u2014 to the point that potentially flattering and unflattering news headlines about the company are sketched out for review. The documents show that Facebook has declined to deploy some mitigation tactics when chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has objected on the basis that they will cause too many \u201cfalse positives\u201d or might stop people from engaging with its platforms.\nThe documents report, for example, that Facebook research, based on data from 2019, found that misinformation shared by politicians was more damaging than that coming from ordinary users. Yet the company maintained a policy that year that explicitly allowed political leaders to lie without facing the possibility of fact checks.\nThat same year, a report titled \u201cCarol\u2019s Journey to QAnon\u201d examined how Facebook\u2019s recommendation algorithms affected the feeds to an experimental account supposedly representing a conservative mother in North Carolina. The report found that rapid polarization was an entrenched feature in how the platform operated. The first QAnon page landed in the conservative user\u2019s feed in just five days.\n\u201cThe content in this account [followed primarily via various recommendation systems!] devolved to a quite troubling, polarizing state in an extremely short period of time,\u201d concluded the research, which was among the documents Haugen shared with the SEC but had also been previously reported by Vice News. Still, Facebook allowed QAnon to operate on its site largely unchecked for another 13 months before its first attempted crack down, which proved so ineffective that the company imposed new sanctions two months later.\nCompany research also revealed in an undated document that XCheck \u2014 the \u201ccross-check\u201d program created to prevent \u201cpr fires\u201d by imposing an extra layer of oversight when the accounts of politicians and other users with large followings faced enforcement action \u2014 had devolved into a widely abused \u201cwhite list\u201d that effectively placed the powerful largely beyond the reach of company policies.\nThe internal analysis called the program a \u201cbreach of trust,\u201d saying bluntly that the company did \u201cnot actually do what we say we do publicly.\u201d But the report itself remained undisclosed until it was revealed by the Wall Street Journal last month. On Thursday, Facebook\u2019s Oversight Board blasted the company for failing to disclose enough information for it to evaluate XCheck. In a statement, the board said, \u201cFacebook admitted it should not have said that cross-check only applied to a \u2018small number of decisions.\u2019 \u201d\nEven when Facebook deployed tools to prevent harm, its own studies found that those tools sometimes failed to operate as promised. After the company decided this year to stop recommending political groups entirely, according to the documents, a third of the listed civic and political groups continued to be seen by users over a period from just before the election through mid-January.\nStop the Steal, which became a rallying cry for those who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, was particularly problematic, the documents reveal. Facebook moved quickly to ban the main Stop the Steal group \u2014 and publicly announced the move as one of its \u201cexceptional measures\u201d for \u201cthis period of heightened tension\u201d \u2014 after determining that it was surging with hateful comments, white supremacy and incitements to violence. But other groups touting the slogan \u201cstop the steal\u201d began to experience \u201cmeteoric growth,\u201d one internal document reported. The ranks of one such group were artificially bolstered by 137 \u201csuper inviters\u201d who each had invited more than 500 people.\nInside the \u2018shadow reality world\u2019 promoting the lie that the presidential election was stolen\nThe report called the company\u2019s response \u201cpiecemeal\u201d as Facebook officials struggled to determine whether these new groups were a \u201ccoordinated effort to delegitimize the election\u201d or were \u201cprotected free expression from users who were confused or afraid or deserved our empathy.\u201d\nThe answer became obvious in hindsight, prompting an urgent internal effort \u201cto learn what we can about the growth of the election delegitimizing movements that grew, spread conspiracy, and helped incite the Capitol insurrection.\u201d\nFacebook\u2019s sprawling effort to protect the 2020 election was years in the making, with many measures given trial runs in the 2018 U.S. midterm congressional elections and also during votes in other countries, current and former employees say.\nFacebook\u2019s tool kit was extensive, including running banners and labels with authoritative information and measures such as dialing down the virality of problematic content through tweaks to the algorithms that determine what users see. Routine spreaders of false or hateful content, for example, might find their posts mysteriously reaching smaller audiences. Those seeking to suppress voter turnout might find themselves banned, company documents detailing these measures show.\nPerspective: Twitter and Facebook warning labels aren\u2019t enough to save democracy\nFacebook also created a command center \u2014 initially called a \u201cwar room\u201d when the idea debuted in 2018 \u2014 that was staffed around-the-clock to monitor and check abuses before they could spread widely.\nThis approach was shaped by the intense political backlash Facebook experienced after the discovery that Russian operatives had spread disinformation designed to polarize the American populace and help elect Trump in 2016. Scholars still debate how effective the Russian interference on Facebook was, but the ensuing scandal engulfed the company, prompting harsh congressional scrutiny and broad public anger.\nThe controversy, which continued for months, prompted public apologies by Zuckerberg and other Facebook officials, and, former employees say, it strengthened the hands of reformers within the company. They pushed for research to develop teams and tools that made Facebook better at controlling malevolent, misleading efforts by foreigners.\nThe payoff came on Election Day in November. Although some problems did persist \u2014 one internal report obtained separately by The Post said that nearly a quarter of Facebook users reported seeing hate speech ahead of the election and that more than half reported seeing content that made them wary of discussing political issues in public \u2014 close races in several states and questions about the national outcome made problems at Facebook, at worst, a subplot.\nOne former executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the overall goal of Facebook\u2019s election strategy \u201cwas to make sure Facebook wasn\u2019t the story.\u201d\nMany at the company felt that on that score, they had succeeded.\nBut problems began to arise immediately after the election, as Trump and his allies began touting false claims about his loss. In a Nov. 5 post on Workplace, an employee noted that the top comment appearing below a news story about coming vote counts included a link to a false news report. \u201cNot only do we not do something about combustible election misinformation in comments, we amplify them and give them broader distribution,\u201d the employee wrote.\nA few weeks later the company began rolling back \u2014 as had always been planned \u2014 some unusually aggressive measures that had helped control toxic speech and misinformation on its platforms, although some others remained in place, officials say. In addition to outright bans and removals, these election-season measures had included what Facebook calls \u201csoft actions\u201d that quietly slowed the spread of problematic content but stopped short of outright bans or removals.\nThose measures, detailed in company documents, included requiring administrators of groups that had a large number of strikes against them for violent or hateful content to review posts before they went up and freezing comments in those groups, reducing the number of invitations a group administrator could send from 100 to 30, and the triggering of a special set of algorithms that would automatically reduce the spread of content the software interpreted as possible hate speech.\nSeveral measures also were aimed at groups and pages that, like the ones touting Stop the Steal, sought to \u201cdelegitimize\u201d the 2020 election, according to a company document detailing such measures. One barred them from Facebook\u2019s \u201crecommendation engine.\u201d Another prevented existing groups from changing their names to terms that undermined the election\u2019s legitimacy. They blocked the algorithm\u2019s ability to recommend live video on political topics.\nMisinformation on Facebook got six times more clicks than factual news during the 2020 election, study says\nAs Facebook lifted these controls after the election, company leaders did one thing more that only a handful of insiders knew was coming: It dismantled the Civic Integrity group that included Haugen and others who had spent years working on combating dangerous content on Facebook.\nOfficials said their goal was to redistribute these roughly 200 employees across the company. But when Haugen and others heard the news, they were aghast. This was a company \u2014 as they knew better than most \u2014 that was notorious for its record of facilitating the warping of elections, incitements to political violence and the pushing of voters everywhere into self-reinforcing partisan bubbles.\nFacebook\u2019s vice president for integrity, Guy Rosen, wrote in a Dec. 2 note to his team: \u201cWe\u2019ve made incredible progress in getting problems under control, and many of us looked to the US 2020 elections as a major milestone on this path. I\u2019m so very proud of this team and everything we\u2019ve accomplished.\u201d\nHe then outlined a new organizational structure in which the responsibilities previously assigned to Civic Integrity were redistributed to several other teams. Rosen portrayed it in his note as a sign of Civic Integrity\u2019s success and maturation. Those on the team and others familiar with internal deliberations at the company did not see it that way.\nThe issue, said people familiar with internal discussions at Facebook, was that Civic Integrity team members had grown too vocal, with a succession of them airing their concerns in posts on Workplace, visible in many cases to more than 60,000 employees worldwide. Many of these posts became fodder for unflattering news coverage.\n\u201cThe leadership was not happy with how loud the Civic Integrity team was. They wanted to decentralize the team and the power they had,\u201d said one former company official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. \u201cThe way they approached it, it didn\u2019t feel like they were saying, \u2018You guys did a great job; thank you for your service.\u2019 It was like, \u2018We\u2019re going to split up the family.\u2019\u201d\nBut whatever public relations problems the Civic Integrity team was creating as an intact unit would become more serious as the company moved to dissolve the unit. Haugen and others began considering whether to speak out about what they had learned about their employer.\nAs Jan. 6 approached, Facebook began tracking a rise in toxic content on its platforms, according to former employees and a Facebook document that also listed potential \u201cbreak the glass\u201d measures that had been in place during the election but \u201cpreviously rolled back.\u201d Facebook officials say these measures had been lifted gradually into December, though some continued through February.\nJust a few weeks later many Facebook employees watched, alarmed, as Trump made an incendiary speech to supporters gathered on the White House Ellipse. Soon they were filled with dread as rioters descended on the U.S. Capitol, said former employees, and it became clear that Stop the Steal was no mere Facebook group showing worrying signs of political extremism.\n41 minutes of fear: A video timeline from inside the Capitol siege\nAs violence engulfed the Capitol, the policy team based in Washington as well as data scientists in the company\u2019s integrity division began preparing for unprecedented measures against Trump, including what would become an initial 24-hour ban of the president. The Washington policy office, whose leadership ranks were dominated by Republicans, had, since Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, played a key role in adapting company rules for the Trump era \u2014 creating exceptions, for example, that allowed hate speech from a political leader so long as it was deemed \u201cnewsworthy.\u201d\nBut his central role in inciting violence at the Capitol had become impossible to ignore, former employees said. Zuckerberg announced the temporary ban on Trump later that day.\nPolicymakers in the Washington office also worried that some of their friends might be trapped inside the Capitol, in personal danger while simply doing their highly political jobs. When Zuckerberg sent a companywide note expressing relief that no employee was at risk, several in the Washington office bristled. How did he know? They soon concluded that he did not, and could not, have known yet, said several people familiar with the incident.\nAnother top executive who became the target of employee discontent that day was Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer, a well-liked executive seen as being close to Zuckerberg.\n\u201cI\u2019m saddened [by] the attack on the most fundamental part of America: the peaceful transfer of power,\u201d Schroepfer wrote on Workplace, apparently in response to a post from Zuckerberg calling Jan. 6 \u201ca dark moment in our nation\u2019s history.\u201d\nSchroepfer added, \u201cHang in there everyone as we figure out the best ways to support our teams and manage discourse on our platform to allow for peaceful discussion and organization but not calls for violence.\u201d\nThat sentiment was met with rage.\n\u201cI\u2019m struggling to match my values with my employment here,\u201d wrote one employee on Workplace whose name was redacted in the copy shared with The Post. \u201cI came here hoping to affect change and improve society, but all I\u2019ve seen is atrophy and abdication of responsibility. I\u2019m tired of platitudes; I want action items. We\u2019re not a neutral entity.\u201d\nAnother employee, whose name also was redacted from the documents, recalled the anger in June 2020, after Black Lives Matter protesters had been forcibly cleared from a park next to the White House before Trump walked through for a photo opportunity during which he denounced the demonstrations.\n\u201cEmployees have been crying out for months to start treating high-level political figures the same way we treat each other on the platform. That\u2019s all we\u2019re asking for,\u201d the employee wrote. \u201cLast we spoke, innocent protesters were tear-gassed under the orders of a political figure whose message was amplified. Today, a coup was attempted against the United States. I hope circumstances aren\u2019t even more dire next time we speak.\u201d\nFacebook finally took its most aggressive action yet the day after the Capitol attack, banning Trump \u201cindefinitely\u201d from the platform for inciting violence. The many exceptions Facebook had made to allow for the president\u2019s rule-bending behavior had reached their limit.\nBut in the days after the insurrection, Facebook went out of its way to play down the company\u2019s role in what happened on Jan. 6. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, appearing at a live event, made a point of saying that the events that day were largely organized on other platforms \u201cthat don\u2019t have our abilities to stop hate.\u201d\nSandberg\u2019s comments struck some people within Facebook as tone-deaf, as if company leaders were attempting a victory lap in the wake of a historic tragedy.\n\u201cThat was the last straw for me,\u201d said one former executive, who quit shortly after Sandberg\u2019s statement. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know the full extent, but we knew it was disingenuous.\u201d\nTom Hamburger contributed to this report.\nThe Facebook Papers are a set of internal documents that were provided to Congress in redacted form by Frances Haugen\u2019s legal counsel. The redacted versions were reviewed by a consortium of news organizations, including The Washington Post.\nThe trove of documents show how Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has, at times, contradicted, downplayed or failed to disclose company findings on the impact of its products and platforms.\nThe documents also provided new details of the social media platform\u2019s role in fomenting the storming of the U.S. Capitol. An investigation by ProPublica and The Washington Post found that Facebook groups swelled with at least 650,000 posts attacking the legitimacy of Joe Biden\u2019s victory between Election Day and Jan. 6.\nFacebook engineers gave extra value to emoji reactions, including \u2018angry,\u2019 pushing more emotional and provocative content into users\u2019 news feeds.\nRead more from The Post\u2019s investigation:\nKey takeaways from the Facebook Papers\nFrances Haugen took thousands of Facebook documents.

REUTERS\/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria  Acquire Licensing Rights\nCARACAS, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition said on Wednesday it will hold a presidential primary on Oct. 22 to choose a candidate to face the ruling party in presidential elections tentatively scheduled for 2024.\nThe primary is the opposition's first since 2012.

Oil revenues are crucial to Venezuela's crippled economy.\nTuesday's meeting in Barbados, brokered by Norway, was the first between the two sides in 11 months.\nThe talks, meant to provide a way out of Venezuela's long-running political and economic crisis, will continue at an unspecified date, the parties said, adding they are committed to respecting the results of the vote.\nThe deal says each side can choose its 2024 candidate according to its internal rules, but did not reverse bans on some opposition figures - including Oct. 22 primary frontrunner Maria Corina Machado - that prevent them from holding office.\nThe opposition has said the bans, handed down by the controller general, are unlawful and Washington has rejected any roadblocks to opposition candidates.\n\"If you have an administrative inhabilitation...from the controller general of the republic you cannot be a candidate, I want to clarify that,\" Jorge Rodriguez, the head of the government delegation told a press conference after the signing.\nSpeaking before Rodriguez, the head of the opposition delegation Gerardo Blyde had said the deal could allow banned candidates to \"recover their rights.\"\nThe opposition has shied away from laying out what could happen if Machado were to win the primary but could not register for the general election.\nIt remains unclear whether the often-fractious opposition would accept her choosing another candidate to run in her stead.\nAt least two candidates who initially had been set to run in the primary have bowed out because they are banned.\nMaduro, president since 2013, is expected to run for re-election but has not yet formalized his candidacy.\nThe U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela to punish Maduro's government following a 2018 election that Washington considered a sham. Since 2019, U.S. sanctions have banned PDVSA from exporting its oil to its chosen markets.\nThe other accord signed by the two sides includes an agreement to protect Houston-based oil refiner Citgo Petroleum, whose parent company's shares will be put for auction starting this month through a court-organized process to pay creditors.\nReporting by Deisy Buitrago and Vivian Sequera in Caracas and Matt Spetalnick in Washington; Writing by Julia Symmes Cobb and Matt Spetalnick; Editing by Will Dunham, Josie Kao and Lincoln Feast.\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nThomson Reuters\nDeisy reports on oil and energy and general news from Venezuela's capital, Caracas.

Since 2019, U.S. sanctions have banned state-run oil company PDVSA from exporting to its chosen markets.\nThe changes announced on Wednesday include the issuance of a six-month general license allowing the production, sale and export of Venezuela's crude and gas, without limitations on customers or destinations, and another general license authorizing dealings with Minerven \u2013 the Venezuelan state-owned gold mining company.\nThe U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement, however, that it was prepared to revoke those authorizations at any time if representatives of Maduro fail to follow through on their commitments in the deal with the opposition.\nTreasury also removed the secondary trading ban on certain Venezuelan sovereign bonds and state-run oil company PDVSA debt and equity, though a ban on trading in the primary Venezuelan bond market remains in place, it said.\nThe U.S. has been seeking ways to boost global flows of oil to alleviate high prices caused by sanctions on Russia and OPEC+ decisions to reduce output.\nBut the chances Venezuela's exports could offset those cuts are slim absent a big increase in investment in the country's crippled oil sector, oil industry experts said.\nTwo decades of mismanagement and insufficient investment, coupled with U.S. oil sanctions since 2019, are expected to stymie state-run PDVSA's ability to make a quick comeback to cash-paying oil markets and offer its crude at fair prices.\nTalks between the government and the opposition, meant to provide a way out of Venezuela's long-running political and economic crisis, were held on Tuesday for the first time in nearly a year.

Acquire Licensing Rights Read more\nCARACAS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado is leading the vote count in the Venezuelan opposition's presidential primary by a huge margin and has claimed victory in the Sunday contest, with final results pending.\nThe vote to choose a unity opposition candidate to face President Nicolas Maduro in his probable re-election bid next year came amid pledges by the United States to roll back sanctions relief if the government fails to lift bans preventing some opposition figures from holding office.\nMachado was tallying 93% of the vote, with just over 26% of ballot boxes counted, the primary's organizing commission said around midnight.\n\"From tonight we begin a great movement for a great national alliance for the transformation of Venezuela,\" Machado said at her campaign headquarters.\n\"Today I received a mandate and I accept with Venezuelans the commitment of making that mandate matter.\"\nThe count - delayed by a server blockage - was expected to resume later on Monday. It was unclear when the next results update would be given.\nMachado's nearest rival, former lawmaker Carlos Prosperi, had 4.75% of the vote.\nParticipation in the vote, organized without state help, was more than double what had been expected in some states. Venezuela has about 20 million eligible voters.\nPolling places - including in private homes and on street corners - were meant to close at 4 p.m. (2000 GMT), but many remained opened hours later, so those waiting in long lines could vote or so additional ballots could be delivered.\nSome of the estimated 3,000 polling locations nationwide had to be moved, according to human rights groups and voters, causing confusion.\nVoters also faced transportation problems. Gasoline availability was limited in border states Tachira and Bolivar and public transport in the country's interior was working irregularly, according to Reuters witnesses.\n\"On Friday we waited in three lines to be able to get gasoline for today and we couldn't,\" said housewife Melissa Diaz, 39, who arrived at her polling place in eastern Guyana City with a nearly empty tank.\n\"We've lost a whole day, but even if we had to walk or cycle, we were coming to vote.\"\nMachado, 56, an industrial engineer, has led her rivals by some 40 points in polls.\nBut Machado, like two former rivals who dropped out of the race, is barred from public office over her support of the sanctions on Maduro's government and would not be able to register for the general election.\nThe opposition and government this week signed a deal on some election guarantees, including the presence of international observers. The accord allows each side to choose its candidate according to internal rules, but did not retract the election disqualifications.\nThe United States, which broadly eased Trump-era sanctions on Venezuelan oil and gas and bonds in response to the deal, has said Maduro has until the end of November to begin rescinding the bans and releasing political prisoners and \"wrongfully detained\" Americans.\nThough five people were released, lead government negotiator Jorge Rodriguez confirmed this week that those with disqualifications cannot run in the 2024 contest, set for the second half of the year.\nSome in the opposition have said they are skeptical Maduro will follow through on the deal.\nThe opposition, which says the disqualifications are unlawful, has been reticent to say what it would do if Machado wins the primary but is unable to compete in 2024.\nMachado - who says her goal is to remove Maduro in a fair and peaceful vote - has said she would pressure the electoral authorities to let her register. Maduro has not announced that he will seek re-election, but many observers expect him to run.\nOthers have argued selecting a substitute candidate would be necessary, although whether the often-fractious opposition would accept Machado choosing a replacement remains to be seen.\nTen candidates are competing in the primary, where candidates have pledged to come up with solutions for the country's long economic crisis.\n\"If you buy diapers you don't buy food, so I buy food and not diapers,\" said 20-year-old hairdresser Rosimar Gonzalez, who voted in central Maracay with her young son in her arms.\n\"We have to change presidents.\"\nAbout 4 million of the 7.7 million Venezuelans migrants who have left their country are estimated to be of voting age and are able to vote at centers in 28 countries.\n\"I came to vote because I want to hug my grandchildren again, because I want to see my country on the road to freedom before I go,\" said a teary Armando Cedeno, 100, who voted in the afternoon in Maracaibo.\n\"I am confident that God will give me that gift.\"\n(This story has been corrected to say the vote count will resume on Monday in paragraph 6)\nReporting by Mayela Armas and Vivian Sequera in Caracas; Additional reporting by Mariela Nava in Maracaibo, Maria Ramirez in Puerto Ordaz, Mircely Guanipa in Maracay, Tibisay Romero in Valencia and Anggy Polanco in San Cristobal; Writing by Julia Symmes Cobb; Editing by Rod Nickel, Andrea Ricci, Josie Kao and Tom Hogue\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.\nThomson Reuters\nSince 2018 Mayela has reported for Reuters on Venezuela\u2019s economy and general news from capital Caracas.

The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes as it has its own criminal investigations into the Capitol attack ongoing.\n  \n\n      Committee members see criminal referrals as a critical part of their work, putting their views on the record in order to complete their investigation \u2013 not as a way to pressure DOJ, one of the sources told CNN. \n  \n\n      \u201cThe committee wants to make sure nothing falls between the cracks and make an emphatic statement who it has identified as key organizers,\u201d of the insurrection, a separate source said. \n  \n\n      Committee members met Tuesday evening to further discuss criminal referrals, but sources say they don\u2019t expect the panel to release the names of who would be subject to a criminal referral at this point.\n  \n\nJanuary 6 committee member says entirety of panel's work will be released in coming weeks\n\n\n      Members still need to vote on the final list of criminal referrals, which sources say still is not finalized.\n  \n\n      The committee\u2019s chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, told reporters earlier Tuesday that the panel has decided to make criminal referrals to the Department of Justice but had not narrowed down the universe of individuals who may be referred.\n  \n\n      Asked whether Thompson believed any witnesses perjured themselves, he said, \u201cthat\u2019s part of the discussion.\u201d\n  \n\n      When the panel makes referrals, Thompson said it will be a separate document from the panel\u2019s final report that will be sent to DOJ. \n  \n\n      The committee is aiming to release its final report and vote publicly on criminal referrals on December 21, Thompson told reporters Wednesday. \u201cThere will be some form of public presentation. We haven\u2019t decided exactly what that would be,\u201d he said.\n  \n\n      A select committee spokesperson confirmed to CNN that criminal referrals will be \u201cconsidered as a final part\u201d of the panel\u2019s work.\n  \n\n      \u201cThe Committee has determined that referrals to outside entities should be considered as a final part of its work. The committee will make decisions about specifics in the days ahead,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n  \n\n      A source also told CNN on Tuesday that the criminal referrals the January 6 committee will ultimately be making \u201cwill be focused on the main organizers and leaders of the attacks.\u201d\n  \n\n      A subcommittee of members was tasked with providing options to the full committee about how to present evidence of possible obstruction, possible perjury and possible witness tampering as well as potential criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, according to multiple sources familiar with the committee\u2019s work.\n  \n\n      Democratic Reps. Jamie Raskin, Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren, and GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the panel, all trained lawyers, comprise this subcommittee. \n  \n\n      Raskin told CNN on Wednesday that everything is \u201cstill on track\u201d but no decisions have been made following the Tuesday meeting as the committee works through where to \u201cdraw the line\u201d when it comes to referrals because there is such a \u201cbroad universe\u201d of potential offenses and offenders.\n  \n\nMAGA-world keeps losing in its efforts to tie up Trump criminal probes in court \n\n\n      Committee members are on the same page, broadly speaking, Raskin told CNN, but a decision on who they ultimately refer to the Justice Department for prosecution \u2013 and for what offenses \u2013 is still a work in progress.\n  \n\n      But Schiff told CNN there is a \u201cconsensus among the members\u201d regarding the referrals and that members are taking a unified approach on that front.\n  \n\n      The decision of whether to issue criminal referrals has loomed large over the committee. Members on the panel have been in wide agreement that Trump and some of his closest allies have committed a crime when he pushed a conspiracy to prevent the peaceful transfer of power, as they\u2019ve laid out in their hearings. But they have long been split over what to do about it, including whether to make a criminal referral of Trump to the Justice Department.\n  \n\n      In the past, the question has led to a vigorous, at times contentious, debate among committee members, sources have said. Those who previously said criminal referrals are not necessary to close out the panel\u2019s investigation say the committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and that the Justice Department does not need Congress to investigate crimes as it has its own criminal investigations into the Capitol attack that are ongoing.\n  \n\n      Still, the idea of a criminal referral of Trump, even if entirely symbolic in nature, has hung like a shadow over the panel since it was first formed, and many members felt it was a necessary measure in order to complete its work.\n  \n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments Wednesday.\n\n\nCNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.\n\n\u00a9 2023 Cable News Network.

Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said in part during the meeting overheard by NBC News that he believed referrals were \u201cwarranted.\u201d\u00a0A source familiar with the committee\u2019s plans told NBC News about the meeting and its location in the Capitol complex. \nThe committee did not respond to requests for comment.\u00a0\nNBC News previously reported that obstruction, conspiracy and incitement of an insurrection were among the charges the committee was considering to recommend against Trump.\nThe criminal referrals carry no official legal weight, and it remains up to the Justice Department to decide whether or not to charge Trump and anyone else the committee might refer.\nSources confirmed after the meeting that the discussions in the room were a review of decisions the committee made previously that would be presented Monday and that the meeting served as a rehearsal of sorts.\nThe committee also discussed John Eastman, a conservative lawyer on Trump's legal team who authored a memo outlining a theory of how Trump could hold on to power on Jan. 6.\nEastman, via his attorney, declined to comment.\nThe committee also plans to refer several Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee for their defiance of congressional subpoenas, NBC News has learned.\n\u201cNone of the subpoenaed members complied,\u201d Raskin said during Sunday\u2019s meetings, presenting the findings of the subcommittee responsible for referrals. \u201cAnd we are now referring four members of Congress for appropriate sanction with the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply.\u201d\nAsked for comment, a Trump campaign spokesperson shared a statement from Friday attacking the committee, adding that the campaign will have more to say after the referrals are made public Monday.\nThe bipartisan committee, which is winding down its work before the end of the year, has rushed to file its findings into a lengthy, eight-chapter report set to be released to the public Wednesday.\nAli Vitali is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News, based in Washington.\nKate Santaliz is a researcher for NBC News\u2019 Capitol Hill team.\nHaley Talbot is an associate producer in the NBC News Washington bureau.\n\u00a9\u00a02023 NBC UNIVERSAL","27":"\nProfile\nSections\ntv\nFeatured\nMore From NBC\nFollow NBC News\nThere are no new alerts at this time\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The House Jan. 6 committee voted Monday to recommend that the Justice Department pursue a batch of criminal charges against former President Donald Trump for his role in an effort to overturn the 2020 election and the fomenting of a deadly mob at the Capitol.\nTrump was the first president in American history to be impeached twice. Now, he is also the first president to be formally referred by Congress for potential prosecution.\nThe committee's final meeting was the culmination of a sweeping 17-month congressional investigation that included more than 100 subpoenas, interviews with more than 1,200 witnesses and the collection of hundreds of thousands of documents. \nThe select committee also took aim at Trump\u2019s top allies \u2014 on and off Capitol Hill \u2014 who worked with the former president to block certification of Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s election victory and illegitimately keep Trump in power.\n\u201cWe understand the gravity of each and every referral we are making today, just as we understand the magnitude of the crime against democracy that we describe in our report,\u201d said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who led the Jan. 6 subcommittee that examined referrals. \u201cBut we have gone where the facts and the law lead us, and inescapably they lead us here.\u201d\u00a0\nThe Jan. 6 panel also issued a criminal referral to the Department of Justice for conservative attorney John Eastman, who the committee says was the architect of the scheme to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject states\u2019 electoral votes on Jan. 6 and have fake electors submitted to the Congress instead.\u00a0\nAnd it referred four Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee for defying subpoenas from the committee earlier this year, including House Minority Leader and potential incoming Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. The others are: Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who is expected to be the next chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and Scott Perry, R-Pa. \nRaskin said there may be others worthy of prosecution and there may be other statutes that Trump violated, noting the Justice Department will be able to form \"a far more complete picture\" through its own ongoing investigation. \nPressed why Trump and Eastman were the only ones formally referred to DOJ, Raskin told reporters there was an internal debate within the committee about the scope of the referrals. While the committee found that other Trump associates \u2014 including Mark Meadows, Rudy Giuliani and Jeffrey Clark \u2014 were \u201cactors\u201d in the plot to overturn the election, Raskin said, investigators were \u201cstymied\u201d because some individuals chose not to cooperate with the Jan. 6 panel.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cWe focused on the masterminds and the ring-leaders, and we trust that the Department of Justice will do its job, as they\u2019ve been doing,\u201d Raskin said after the meeting.\nThe committee is wrapping up its work before it disbands at the end of the year. But Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said the nation finds itself \"in strange and uncharted waters.\" \n\"We\u2019ve never had a president of the United States stir up a violent attempt to block the transfer of power,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we are to survive as a nation of laws and democracy, this can never happen again.\u201d\nThe Jan. 6 committee is urging DOJ to consider a number of charges against Trump, including conspiracy to defraud the federal government; obstruction of an official proceeding, in this case Congress\u2019 certification of electoral votes; conspiracy to make a false statement; and inciting or assisting those in an insurrection.\nThe criminal referrals do not carry any legal weight but represent a symbolic rebuke of Trump, who remains the most influential Republican in the country and has launched another bid for president. \nJack Smith, the independent special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, is already investigating Trump on numerous fronts, including for his role in the Jan. 6 riot.\nResponding to the criminal referral, Eastman said the Jan. 6 panel had failed to address gaps in Capitol security and the electoral system and instead chose to focus on a \u201cpretend\u201d criminal case.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u201cA criminal \u2018referral\u2019 from a congressional committee is not binding on the Department of Justice and carries no more legal weight than a \u2018referral\u2019 from any American citizen,\" Eastman said in a statement. \u201cIn fact, a \u2018referral\u2019 from the January 6th committee should carry a great deal less weight due to the absurdly partisan nature of the process that produced it.\u201d\nThe committee used its final hearing to summarize the key investigatory threads from its nine previous hearings and to stitch them together into a case against Trump. \n\u201cAt the heart of our republic is the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power. ... Every President in our history has accepted this peaceful transfer of power \u2014 except one,\u201d the committee's vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said of Trump.\nCheney said that \"among the most shameful\" findings of the committee was that Trump sat in the White House watching the violence unfold on TV on Jan. 6, but did nothing, even as advisers and allies begged him to call off the rioters.\n\"This was an utter moral failure,\" Cheney said of Trump's inaction. \"No man who would behave that way, at that moment in time, can ever serve in any position of authority in our nation again. He is unfit for any office.\"\nWitnesses, most of them Republicans, testified to the Jan. 6 panel that Trump and his inner circle had furiously worked to sow doubt about Biden\u2019s legitimate election victory. \nThey testified that Trump launched a multipronged campaign to pressure state officials, senior Justice Department officials and Vice President Mike Pence to help overturn the election.\nThey said Trump directed a mob of thousands of his supporters to march on the Capitol to disrupt lawmakers from certifying the results of the election. \nAnd the witnesses, which included many former Trump White House aides, said he refused to call off his supporters as they brutally assaulted police officers and stormed the halls of Congress while chanting threats to \"hang Mike Pence\" and target lawmakers by name. \nTrump recently used his Truth Social platform to slam the Jan. 6 investigators as \"corrupt cowards who hate this country.\u201d The House impeached him for his role in the attack, but he was acquitted by the Senate. \nThe committee on Monday also voted to formally adopt its full report on its Jan. 6 investigation, which kicked off in July 2021.

Kennedy assassination and the 9\/11 terrorist attack, the Jan. 6 report will be zipped off to numerous book publishers and is expected to become an instant best seller.\nBut Thompson said his committee's report will be different in one significant way: It will be released first digitally, which will allow the panel to link to evidence that can provide the public with greater context.\n\"Whereas other reports have just been a bunch of pages, we think the digital part will add another dimension to it,\" Thompson told reporters.\nDuring the hearing, Thompson also spoke directly to the American people, saying they will now decide on accountability for Trump\u2019s actions as he seeks the White House again.\n\u201cThe future of our democracy rests in your hands,\u201d the Jan. 6 Committee chairman said during the hearing. \u201cIt\u2019s up to the people of this country to decide who deserves the public trust.

Jamie Raskin, D-Md., as he addressed his fellow panel members.\n\"Ours is not a system of justice where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass,\" Raskin said.\nWhile the Justice Department, which is already conducting an investigation of Trump, takes criminal referrals seriously, it is not obligated to charge anyone with a crime.\nHowever, the House panel's referral underscores how seriously the committee views Trump's actions after the election, in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, invasion of the halls of Congress by a mob of his supporters.\nThe nine-member panel is composed of seven Democrats and two Republicans, Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. Cheney was defeated in the GOP primary earlier this year, losing to Rep.-elect Harriet Hageman, while Kinzinger did not seek reelection this year.\nTrump, who has denied any wrongdoing, has not been charged with any crimes related to the 2020 election and the attack on the U.S. Capitol.\nFive people died as an immediate result of the riot, one of them a Capitol Police officer, Brian Sicknick. Nearly 140 other Capitol and Washington, D.C., police officers were injured in the attack, and several cops took their own lives on the heels of the riot.\nIf Trump were to be charged with and convicted of insurrection, he theoretically could be barred from holding federal office again under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Trump last month announced that he will seek the Republican nomination for president in 2024.\nThe committee on Monday also recommended that the DOJ investigate and potentially prosecute Trump's election law attorney John Eastman for his role in advancing a plan to overturn the election results. Eastman's referral was for his alleged violation of two criminal statutes: impeding an official proceeding of the United States government, and conspiring to defraud the United States.\nEastman was the author of a\u00a0two-page memo\u00a0that outlined a plan for then-Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify several states' Electoral College electors when Congress met for that purpose on Jan. 6.\nRaskin said the committee would refer four members of Congress \"for appropriate sanction by the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with lawful subpoenas.\" He did not name them, but House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is among the members who defied a subpoena from the committee.\nAs it made its referrals, the committee released a 154-page executive summary of its investigation.\nThe committee's actions Monday come after nearly 18 months of investigation, which included more than 1,200 witness interviews, the examination of hundreds of thousands of documents, the issuance of more than 100 subpoenas, and public hearings.\nThe DOJ already is conducting a criminal probe of Trump for his actions after the election, which involved an effort to reverse his losses to President Joe Biden in several swing states and to pressure Pence to refuse to accept Congress' certification of Biden's victory in the Electoral College.\nThe DOJ also is separately investigating him for his removal of government documents from the White House when he left office in January 2021.\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in a statement Monday lauded the committee's work.\n\"With painstaking detail, this executive summary documents the sinister plot to subvert the Congress, shred the Constitution and halt the peaceful transfer of power,\" Pelosi said, adding that she respects the panel's findings.\n\"Our Founders made clear that, in the United States of America, no one is above the law,\" Pelosi said. \"This bedrock principle remains unequivocally true, and justice must be done.\"\nJack Smith, who was appointed special counsel for the DOJ last month to handle its investigations of Trump, said at the time of that appointment, \"I intend to conduct the assigned investigations, and any prosecutions that may result from them, independently and in the best traditions of the Department of Justice.\"\nSmith added at that time: \"The pace of the investigations will not pause or flag under my watch. I will exercise independent judgement and will move the investigations forward expeditiously and thoroughly to whatever outcome the facts and the law dictate.\"\nTrump has called the investigations into his conduct after the 2020 election \"witch hunts\" and defended his actions as legitimate.\nHe continues to falsely claim he won the election and that Biden's victory was the result of widespread voter fraud in the swing states he lost.\nTrump also has claimed that Pence had the authority to reject the Electoral College votes of those contested swing states. However, Pence concluded he did not have that power, a conclusion that is backed by a wide array of constitutional scholars and others.\nA Trump spokesman over the weekend told NBC News in a statement, \"The January 6th un-Select Committee held show trials by Never Trump partisans who are a stain on this country's history.\"\n\"This Kangaroo court has been nothing more than a vanity project that insults Americans' intelligence and makes a mockery of our democracy,\" the spokesman said.\nGot a confidential news tip?

And he certainly knew enough to cancel any plans for a march to the Capitol,\u201d the committee wrote.\n\u201cAccording to testimony obtained by the Select Committee, Trump knew that elements of the crowd were armed, and had prohibited items, and that many thousands would not pass through the magnetometers for that reason. Testimony indicates that the President had received an earlier security briefing, and testimony indicates that the Secret Service mentioned the prohibited items again as they drove President Trump to the Ellipse,\u201d the summary stated.\nDaniel Barnes\nIn a virtual news conference late Monday afternoon, conservative attorney John Eastman pushed back against the committee's characterization of his request for a presidential pardon.\nThe committee wrote in its executive summary that Eastman's request to be added to the \u201cpardon list\u201d after Jan. 6, 2021, revealed his \u201cclear consciousness of guilt.\"\nEastman argued he'd asked to be put on the list in response to \"weeks\" of false attacks against him.\n\"I said, look, given that false story maybe I should be on the pardon list, just to avoid having to defend against that \u2014 what was clearly constitutionally protected speech,\" Eastman said, adding that it \"never went anywhere.\"\nThe committee said Monday it would send a criminal referral for Eastman to the Justice Department, arguing that he was the architect of an unlawful scheme to pressure Pence to reject states\u2019 electoral votes on Jan. 6 and have fake electors submitted to Congress instead.\nEastman also seemed to offer a preview of his defense to a potential criminal indictment, saying that whether or not he acted \u201ccorruptly\u201d would be \u201cfront and center to the case.\u201d\n\u201cTo prove that there would have to be first evidence that there was no illegality or fraud in the election and that I knew that at the time,\u201d Eastman said. \u201cAnd neither of those things is true.\"\nSummer Concepcion and Kyle Stewart\nAs Rudy Giuliani pushed forward with litigation to sow doubt on the election process, Trump campaign staffers began viewing Giuliani as \u201cunhinged,\u201d the executive summary of the committee\u2019s report says.\nMultiple law firms that had worked for the campaign\u00a0quit after having refused to participate in his legal strategy, it continues.\nCampaign manager Bill Stepien, who recalled growing \u201cwary of the new team,\u201d told the committee he had his assistant lock his door.\n\u201cAnd, sure enough, Mayor Giuliani tried to get in my office and ordered her to unlock the door, and she didn\u2019t do that,\" he said. \"She\u2019s smart about that.\u201d\nGarrett Haake and Matt Korade\nWhile the committee was meeting, former President Donald Trump repeated his claim in a radio interview that ahead of Jan. 6 he ordered thousands of troops to be ready to respond in case of protests \u2014 an assertion the panel had refuted in the executive summary of its report.\nAsked in an interview with conservative talk radio host Dan Bongino about the committee's actions Monday, Trump called the panel \"a kangaroo court\" and said its members had failed to mention his video statement hours after the riot began urging his supporters to go home. He added that the committee also didn't mention his claim that he ordered 10,000 troops to be prepared for protests days before the riot unfolded. \nThe committee, however, addressed that claim in its summary.\n\u201cSome have suggested that President Trump gave an order to have 10,000 troops ready for January 6th. The select committee found no evidence of this.\" it said. \"In fact, President Trump\u2019s acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller directly refuted this when he testified under oath.\"\nThe summary then quoted Miller as telling committee staff members \"there was no order from the president.\"\nAsked for comment about the committee's criminal referrals, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung repeated a statement the campaign has used previously, calling the panel a \"Kangaroo court\" that \"held show trials by Never Trump partisans who are a stain on this country\u2019s history.\"\nKyle Stewart\nRep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., responded to the committee's decision to refer him and three other Republicans to the Ethics Committee for defying its subpoenas, calling the referral \u201ctheir final political stunt.\u201d\nBiggs accused the committee of defaming \u201cmy name and my character.\u201d\n\u201cThey only wanted the testimony to have the ability to edit and misconstrue our statements to further their own false narratives, as they did with so many other witnesses,\u201d Biggs said.\n\u00a0\nSummer Concepcion and Sarah Fitzpatrick\nTrump lawyers and supporters \u2014 including Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, Phil Waldron and Michael Flynn \u2014 were asked by the committee to provide proof supporting their claims that the election was stolen. In response, they invoked their Fifth Amendment right, the summary said. Those making the claims did not provide any evidence in subpoenaed documents, either, according to the committee.\n\u201cNot a single witness \u2014 nor any combination of witnesses \u2014 provided the select committee with evidence\u00a0demonstrating that fraud occurred on a scale even remotely close to changing the outcome in any state.\u201d\n\u201cIn short, it was a big scam,\u201d a footnote read.\nLiz Brown-Kaiser\nCapitol Police Chief Thomas Manger testified before the Senate Rules Committee on Monday about changes at the agency since Jan. 6, 2021, and a massive increase in threats against lawmakers over the last few years.\nManger revealed that Capitol Police saw over 9,000 threats against members of Congress last year, and he specifically called out the attacks on Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., and Paul Pelosi.\n\u201cI can tell you that back in 2017, we had 1,000, maybe, somewhere around 1,000, and last year 9,000, and it has gone up steadily and profoundly over the last five or six years,\u201d he told senators.\nManger also discussed the agency's \u201cto-do list\u201d since Jan. 6, from managing security risks to recruitment.\n\u201cAmong the most significant challenges that we\u2019re facing is the ever-changing threat landscape,\u201d Manger said. \u201cHate, intolerance and violence are part of a disturbing trend.\u201d\nFrank Thorp V\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., released a brief statement about the committee's final hearing Monday evening.\n\u201cThe entire nation knows who is responsible for that day. Beyond that, I don\u2019t have any immediate observations,\" McConnell said in a statement shared by his office.\nDaniel Barnes and Rebecca Shabad\nConservative attorney John Eastman said Monday that the \"American people have been ill-served by the January 6th committee and its members\" after it unveiled plans to refer him to the Justice Department.\nIn a statement, he said the committee's move \u2014 a nonbinding recommendation that he be investigated and prosecuted \u2014 carries no more weight than if a regular person had done it.\n\"In fact, a 'referral' from the January 6th committee should carry a great deal less weight due to the absurdly partisan nature of the process that produced it,\" he said. \nThe committee says Eastman was the architect of an unlawful scheme to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject states\u2019 electoral votes on Jan. 6 and have fake electors submitted to the Congress instead.\u00a0\nEastman said the committee \"had the resources and mandate to make important contributions in the area of Capitol Security, Electoral Count Act Reform and other areas of potential legislation.\"\nBut, he said: \"Sadly, this opportunity has been squandered in favor of concocting a pretend 'criminal case' from pretend prosecutors designed to create political advantage for the Democratic Party and stigmatize disfavored political groups.\" \nThe House did pass an overhaul of the Electoral Count Act in September; the Senate hasn't passed it. Legislation that would reform the law is expected to be included in a coming massive government spending package Congress is expected to consider this week.\nAdam Edelman and Ghael Fobes\nThe committee believes the Department of Justice can compel former White House counsel Pat Cipollone to testify about his conversations with Trump, the report summary says.\nCipollone spoke to the committee, and his testimony is quoted extensively in the panel's summary. But he had avoided discussing direct talks with Trump with the committee, because of executive privilege concerns.\n\u201cDuring the ensuing riot, the president refused to condemn the violence or encourage the crowd to disperse despite repeated pleas from his staff and family that he do so,\" the summary says. \"The committee has evidence from multiple sources establishing these facts, including testimony from former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.\u201d\n\u201cAlthough Cipollone\u2019s testimony did not disclose a number of direct communications with President Trump in light of concerns about executive privilege, the department now appears to have obtained a ruling that Cipollone can testify before a grand jury about these communications,\" the summary\u2019s authors wrote. \"Based on the information it has obtained, the committee believes that Cipollone and others can provide direct testimony establishing that President Trump refused repeatedly, for multiple hours, to make a public statement directing his violent and lawless supporters to leave the Capitol.\"\nSummer Concepcion and Michael Kosnar\nA White House security official who monitored Secret Service transmissions from the White House recalls members of then-Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s detail \u201cstarting to fear for their own lives\u201d as the Capitol attack unfolded, the report summary said.\n\u201cThere was a lot of yelling, a lot of \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 a lot [of] very personal calls over the radio,\u201d said the official, whose identity the committee said it withheld because of national security concerns and to guard against retaliation. \u201cSo it was disturbing. I don\u2019t like talking about it, but there were calls to say goodbye to family members, so on and\u00a0so forth. It was getting \u2014 for whatever the reason was on the ground \u2014 the VP detail\u00a0thought that this was about to get very ugly.\u201d\nThe official said members of Pence's detail thought they were \u201crunning out of options\u201d and were \u201cgetting nervous,\u201d and it sounded like they \u201ccame very close to either Service having to use lethal options or worse,\u201d according to the summary.\nAdam Edelman and Liz Brown-Kaiser\nMembers of the Jan. 6 committee, Reps. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., and Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told reporters that the criminal referrals would be sent to the Department of Justice this week but declined to elaborate on additional specifics.\n\u201cWe just have a few more days in businesses so certainly it will happen this week,\u201d Raskin said Monday in response to a question about quickly the committee would send material to DOJ.\nWhen asked whether the committee would be \u201cfilling in the blank\u201d of who was among the \u201cothers,\u201d after Trump and Eastman, to be included in the referrals, Raskin said only that \u201cthe others are all contained in our report, and that\u2019s a judgment that\u2019s going to have to be made by the Department of Justice about whether they have sufficient evidence and probable cause in their case in order to bring charges.\u201d\nSchiff, for his part, said that Trump should be treated like \u201cany other American\u201d by the Justice Department as it weighs whether to charge him.\n\u201cWe believe as we indicated in our criminal referral that Donald J. Trump that there was evidence that he violated multiple criminal laws,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cIf the Justice Department concurs with that assessment and with the evidence, then he should be prosecuted like any other American.\u201d\nKate Santaliz, Haley Talbot, Kyle Stewart and Rebecca Shabad\nTwo of the four members of Congress referred to the House Ethics Committee by the Jan. 6 committee slammed the panel Monday. \nIn a statement to NBC News, Russell Dye, a spokesperson for Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said, \"This is just another partisan and political stunt made by a select committee that knowingly altered evidence, blocked minority representation on a committee for the first time in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives, and failed to respond to Mr. Jordan\u2019s numerous letters and concerns surrounding the politicization and legitimacy of the committee\u2019s work.\"\nJay Ostrich, a spokesperson for Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., said, \"More games from a petulant and soon-to-be defunct kangaroo court desperate for revenge and struggling to get out from under the weight of its own irrelevancy.\"\nThe offices of the two other members, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., did not immediately return NBC News' request for comment.\nRebecca Shabad and Allie Raffa\nIn its report summary, the committee detailed what it said were efforts to obstruct its investigation.\nFor example, the committee said it had received testimony from a witness about her decision to terminate a lawyer who was being paid by a group allied with Trump.\nThe witness, whom the summary didn\u2019t identify, expressed concern that the lawyer advised her that she could \"tell the committee that she did not recall facts when she actually did recall them,\" the summary said. \nThe client was also offered \"potential employment that would make her 'financially very comfortable' as the date of her testimony approached by entities apparently linked to Donald Trump and his associates,\" the summary continued.\nThe witness also testified that multiple people linked to Trump contacted her in advance of her testimony. \n\"What they said to me is, as long as I continue to be a team player, they know that I am on the right team. I am doing the right thing. I am protecting who I need to protect,\" the witness said. \"You know, I will continue to stay in good graces in Trump world. And they have reminded me a couple of times that Trump does read transcripts and just keep that in mind as I proceed through my interviews with the committee.\"\nThe committee said it's also aware of multiple efforts by Trump to contact witnesses that went before the panel's investigators. \"The Department of Justice is aware of at least one of those circumstances,\" the summary said. It also said much of this evidence is already known by the Department of Justice and other prosecutorial authorities.\nVaughn Hillyard and Rebecca Shabad\nTrump has done little over the course of the committee's investigation to deny or respond to the allegations and evidence the panel has presented against him. \nScott Wong and Sarah Mimms\nThe committee announced during Monday's final meeting that it was referring four Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee for\u00a0defying subpoenas\u00a0from the committee\u00a0earlier this year.\nBut Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., did not name those members during the meeting. Instead, those names were made public in a summary of the committee's final report.\nThey are: House Minority Leader and potential incoming Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif; Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who is expected to be the next chairman of the House Judiciary Committee; Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.; and Scott Perry, R-Pa.\n\u201cDespite the Select Committee\u2019s repeated attempts to obtain information from these Members and the issuance of subpoenas, each has refused to cooperate and failed to comply with a lawfully issued subpoena,\" according to the report summary. \"Accordingly, the Select Committee is referring their failure to comply with the subpoenas issued to them to the Ethics Committee for further action. To be clear, this referral is only for failure to comply with lawfully issued subpoenas. \u201c\nRebecca Shabad and Ghael Fobes\nThe Jan. 6 committee said in the summary of its report that the Department of Justice and the district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, might be able to access information unavailable to the congressional panel. \nThe DOJ and the district attorney in Georgia could \"utilize investigative tools, including search warrants and grand juries, superior to the means the committee has for obtaining relevant information and testimony,\" the summary says.\nProsecutors might now have access to testimony from Mark Meadows, Trump's former White House chief of staff, \"and others who either asserted privileges or invoked their Fifth Amendment rights.\"\n\"The department may also be able to access, via grand jury subpoena or otherwise, the testimony of Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, Representative Scott Perry, Representative Jim Jordan and others, each of whom appears to have had materially relevant communications with Donald Trump or others in the White House but who failed to comply with the Select Committee\u2019s subpoenas,\" the summary said. \nAdam Edelman\nOutgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., thanked the members of the Jan. 6 committee for being \u201crelentless\u201d in \u201ctheir pursuit of truth\u201d and demanded that \u201cjustice must be done\u201d following the panel\u2019s last public meeting.\n\u201cWith painstaking detail, this executive summary documents the sinister plot to subvert the Congress, shred the Constitution and halt the peaceful transfer of power,\" Pelosi said in a statement. \"The committee has reached important conclusions about the evidence it has developed, and I respect those findings.\u201d \n\u201cOur Founders made clear that, in the United States of America, no one is above the law.\u00a0 This bedrock principle remains unequivocally true, and justice must be done,\u201d she added.\nSahil Kapur\nThe committee's executive summary highlights a series of revelations and accusations against key figures who have testified. \nAmong them, the panel accuses Ivanka Trump of not being as \"forthcoming as Cipollone and others about President Trump\u2019s conduct,\" saying she exhibited \u201ca lack of full recollection of certain issues.\u201d\nShe wasn\u2019t the only White House official the panel called out. It said portions of former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany\u2019s testimony \u201cseemed evasive, as if she was testifying from pre-prepared talking points.\u201d It added: \u201cIn multiple instances, McEnany\u2019s testimony did not seem nearly as forthright as that of her press office staff, who testified about what McEnany said.\u201d\nRead more highlights from the report summary.\nRebecca Shabad and Daniel Barnes\nThe executive summary says the committee believes Trump wanted to go to the Capitol on Jan. 6 to personally lead the effort to overturn Joe Biden's victory.\n\"The committee\u2019s principal concern was that the president actually intended to participate personally in the January 6th efforts at the Capitol, leading the attempt to overturn the election either from inside the House chamber, from a stage outside the Capitol, or otherwise,\" the summary said. \n\"The committee regarded those facts as important because they are relevant to President Trump\u2019s intent on January 6th,\" the summary continued. \"There is no question from all the evidence assembled that President Trump did have that intent.\"\nThe summary then said a White House security official who was in the White House complex on Jan. 6 became \"very concerned about his intentions,\" referring to Trump. The committee interviewed the official on July 11, 2022, and kept his identity confidential \"due to their sensitive national security responsibilities.\"\n\"[W]e all knew what that implicated and what that meant, that this was no longer a rally, that this was going to move to something else if he physically walked to the Capitol,\" the official said. \"I don\u2019t know if you want to use the word 'insurrection,' 'coup,' whatever. We all knew that this would move from a normal, democratic, you know, public event into something else.\"\nAdam Edelman and Daniel Barnes\nThe committee's executive summary also provides more detail on the bombshell testimony this summer from Cassidy Hutchinson, a former top aide to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.\nHutchinson had testified that Trump tried to grab the steering wheel of his presidential vehicle and lunged toward his security detail when he was informed he would not be taken to the Capitol after his Jan. 6 rally.\n\u201cAfter he exited the stage, President Trump entered the presidential SUV and forcefully expressed his intention that Bobby Engel, the head of his Secret Service detail, direct the motorcade to the Capitol,\" the summary says. \"The committee has now obtained evidence from several sources about a \u2018furious interaction\u2019 in the SUV.\"\n\"The vast majority of witnesses who have testified before the select committee about this topic, including multiple members of the Secret Service, a member of the Metropolitan Police, and national security officials in the White House, described President Trump\u2019s behavior as 'irate,' 'furious,' 'insistent,' 'profane' and 'heated,'\" the summary stated.\nRebecca Shabad and Sarah Fitzpatrick\nFormer Trump lawyer and longtime ally Rudy Giuliani, who helped fuel Trump's lies about the 2020 election, said he did not believe the outlandish claims he pushed about voting machines fixing the election, according to the committee's summary of its report.\n\"Giuliani repeatedly had claimed in public that Dominion voting machines stole the election,\" the summary said, but added, \"He admitted during his Select Committee deposition that, 'I do not think the machines stole the election.'\"\u00a0\nSoon after Jan. 6, Dominion Voting Systems, the election equipment manufacturer that became the target of wild conspiracy theories pushed by  Trump and his allies, sued Giuliani for defamation.\nNBC News\nThe House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol\u00a0released a 154-page summary of its findings Monday, the culmination of nearly 18 months of work.\nThe committee says it expects to release the full report later this week, as well as a number of transcripts from witness depositions.\nRead what the committee is calling its introductory material here.\nVaughn Hillyard and Rebecca Shabad\nDuring the Jan. 6 committee's final meeting, Trump made one post to his Truth Social account, saying he would have won the 2020 election if Twitter had not\u00a0blocked a New York Post story\u00a0about Hunter Biden.\n\"This would have easily changed the Presidential Election outcome without even discussing all of the other illegal things they did,\" Trump wrote on his account. \nTrump linked to a Fox News article related to Twitter\u2019s decision to block the\u00a0New York Post\u00a0story on Hunter Biden ahead of the 2020 election. Trump was suggesting that Twitter\u2019s suppression of the story would have given him a second term in the White House. \u00a0\nAli Vitali and Scott Wong\nThe Jan. 6 committee met for what\u2019s likely its final public meeting, with many of the usual faces present. As ever, officers who defended the Capitol were front row \u2014 including U.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, Washington, D.C., Police Officer Daniel Hodges and former Washington Police Officer Michael Fanone.\nReps. Madeline Dean and Mary Gay Scanlon, both Pennsylvania Democrats, former Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., and some members of Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s staff were also present in the room.\nThe hearing room had a quiet energy as the lawmakers began, which endured for the entirety of the meeting.\u00a0\nDuring a lengthy Jan. 6 highlight reel, members looked very serious and solemn. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., sitting next to Cheney, had his hands clasped in front of his face for a full minute.\nWhen Raskin began reading out the referral recommendations, the mood in the room became more tense and alert. Some people took pictures of the screen that laid out specific statutes against Trump, Eastman \u201cand others,\u201d aware that his information was new and what many were waiting on.\nAs they took the recorded vote of each member saying \u201caye\u201d to adopt the panel's final report, the room shifted and some attendees took pictures or video on their phones.\nSome applause broke out right after the hearing wrapped and as members exited. Reps. Stephanie Murphy and Pete Aguilar went to shake hands with the officers in the front row.\u00a0\nMatt Korade\nThe House Jan. 6 committee concluded its meeting, marking an end to nearly a year and a half of work investigating the events surrounding the riot at the Capitol.\nRebecca Shabad\nThe committee has voted unanimously to adopt its final report, which Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., said includes the panel's legislative recommendations and criminal referrals of Trump and others.\nAdam Edelman\nRaskin also announced that his committee would refer four members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee for having refused to comply with subpoenas issued by the Jan. 6 panel.\n\u201cNone of the subpoenaed members complied, and we are now referring four members of Congress for appropriate sanction by the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with lawful subpoenas,\u201d Raskin said.\nRaskin did not immediately say which four members of Congress the panel would refer to the Ethics Committee.\nThere were five members who did not comply with their subpoena requests from the committee: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.; Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa.; Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio; Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.; and Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala.\nSummer Concepcion\nRaskin said the committee will also refer Trump under a U.S. criminal code for inciting, assisting, or engaging in insurrection against the United States and giving \"aid or comfort\" to an insurrection.\n\"An insurrection is a rebellion against the authority of the United States. It is a grave federal offense anchored in the Constitution. ... Anyone who incites others to engage in rebelling, assists them in doing so or gives aid and comfort to those engaged in insurrection is guilty of a federal crime,\" Raskin said.\n\u201cThe Committee believes that more than sufficient evidence exists for a criminal referral of former President Trump for assisting or aiding and comforting those at the Capitol who engaged in a violent attack on the United States,\u201d Raskin continued. \u201cThe Committee has developed significant evidence that President Trump intended to disrupt the peaceful transition of power.\u201d\nSummer Concepcion\nRaskin said the committee is making a referral for Trump and others who made \u201cmaterially false statements\u201d to the federal government \u201cknowingly and willfully.\u201d\n\u201cThe evidence clearly suggests that President Trump conspired with others to submit slates of fake electors to Congress and the National Archives,\u201d Raskin said. \u201cWe believe that this evidence we set forth in our report is more than sufficient for a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump and others in connection with this offense.\u201d\nAdam Edelman\nRaskin has announced that \u201cthere is more than sufficient evidence\u201d to issue criminal referrals asking the Justice Department to pursue criminal charges against Trump, Eastman \u201cand others\u201d for conspiring to defraud the U.S.\n\u201cIn other words, to make an agreement to impair, obstruct, or defeat the lawful functions of the United States government by deceitful or dishonest means,\u201d Raskin said.\nRebecca Shabad and Adam Edelman\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said the committee will refer Trump, lawyer John Eastman and others for obstructing an official proceeding. \nRaskin said the first criminal statute the panel will invoke for referral \"makes it unlawful for anyone to corruptly 'obstruct, influence, or impede any official proceeding' of the United States government.\"\n\"We believe that the evidence described by my colleagues today and assembled throughout our hearings warrants a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump, John Eastman, and others for violations of this statute,\" Raskin said. \"The whole purpose and obvious effect of Trump\u2019s scheme were to 'obstruct, influence, and\u00a0impede' this official proceeding, the central moment for the lawful transfer of power in the United States.\"\nAs is the case with all of the criminal referrals being issued by the committee, these carry no official legal weight, and it remains up to the Department of Justice to decide whether or not to charge the former president and anyone else who might be referred by the committee.\nAdam Edelman\nCommittee members played new testimony from former Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, in which she described Trump defending the rioters in a private conversation on Jan. 7.\nConway told interviewers that during that short conversation with Trump, she'd called Jan. 6 a \"terrible day\" and called it \"crazy.\"\nAsked by interviewers about what Trump said during the conversation, Conway said that Trump defended the rioters saying, \u201cNo, these people are upset. They\u2019re very upset.\"\nRebecca Shabad and Frank Thorp V\nThe committee recounted text messages it received from Hope Hicks, who was serving as a senior White House adviser on the day of the riot.\nHicks was texting with another staffer during the violence to say she had \u201csuggested ... several times\u201d on Jan. 4 and Jan. 5, 2021, that Trump state publicly that Jan. 6 should remain peaceful, and that \"he\" refused her advice, Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., said.\n\"Hey.\u00a0I know you\u2019re seeing this.\u00a0But he ... really should tweet something about Being NON-violent,\" campaign spokesman Hogan Gidley texted Hicks, according to the panel.\nHicks responded: \"I\u2019m not there.\u00a0I suggested it several times Monday and Tuesday and he refused.\"\nThe committee asked Hicks whether \"he\" referred to Trump, but Hicks said she was talking about White House attorney Eric Herschmann. Murphy suggested the public review the transcript of the panel's interview with Herschmann when it is released.\nHicks recalled in testimony before the committee that Herschmann had earlier advised Trump to make a pre-emptive public statement in advance of Jan. 6 urging no violence that day.\nTrump never made any such statement. \nRebecca Shabad\nRep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., said Trump summoned a mob to Washington on Jan. 6, hoping that they would pressure Congress \"to do what he could not do on his own.\"\nOn Dec. 19, 2020, Trump posted a tweet urging his supporters to travel to Washington for a protest on Jan. 6, Murphy said. \"Be there, will be wild!\" he tweeted.\n\"Between December 19th and January 6th, the president repeatedly encouraged his supporters to come to Washington,\" she said. \nTrump's tweet on Dec. 19 \"galvanized domestic violent extremists, including members of the Oath Keepers, the Proud Boys, and organized militia groups,\" Murphy said. \nThe committee found that these people planned to come to D.C. in large numbers \"with the specific intent to use violence to disrupt the certification of the election during the joint session,\" she said. \nSummer Concepcion\nRep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., stressed that Trump still attempted to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to go along with lawyer John Eastman\u2019s theory on overturning the election results, despite Pence and Eastman himself warning that it would be unlawful to do so.\n\u201cJohn Eastman admitted in advance of the 2020 election that Mike Pence could not lawfully refuse to count official electoral votes,\u201d Aguilar said.\u00a0\n\u201cBut he nevertheless devised a meritless proposal that deployed a combination of bogus election fraud claims and the fake electoral ballots to say that Mike Pence, presiding over the joint session, could reject legitimate electoral votes for President-elect Biden,\u201d he continued.\nAdam Edelman\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., summarized how Trump had sought to use the Department of Justice to invalidate the 2020 election \u2014 but that none of Trump\u2019s attorneys general would go along with it.\nKinzinger said that when Bill Barr resigned as attorney general, after having investigated and disproven many of Trump\u2019s false claims of voter fraud, Trump then requested that the acting leaders of the department, Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, \u201cjust say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.\u201d \n\u201cBetween Dec. 23rd and Jan. 3rd, President Trump called or met with them nearly every day, and was told repeatedly that department investigations showed no factual support for Trump\u2019s fraud allegations.\u00a0Mr. Rosen and Mr. Donoghue told him that his fraud claims were simply untrue,\u201d Kinzinger said.\u00a0\nTrump then attempted to install Jeffrey Clark to lead the agency. But a wave of officials threatened to resign if Trump did so, and Trump did not move forward with installing Clark, Kinzinger said.\nRebecca Shabad\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Trump oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false Electoral College ballots to Congress and the National Archives. \nThe false ballots were created by fake GOP electors on Dec. 14, Schiff said, at the same time that the actual, certified electors were meeting in those particular states to cast their votes for Biden. \nAt that point, election-related litigation was over or nearly complete in these states, and Trump campaign lawyers realized fake electors were \"unjustifiable on any grounds, and may be unlawful,\" Schiff said. \n\"In spite of these concerns, and the concerns of individuals in the White House Counsel\u2019s Office, President Trump and others proceeded with this plan,\" Schiff said. \nSchiff said the committee has developed evidence that shows \"these intentionally false documents were transmitted\u00a0to multiple officers of the federal government, and were intended to interfere with the proper conduct of the joint session\" on Jan. 6.\nAdam Edelman\nCommittee members are drawing attention to how even many of Trump\u2019s closest confidantes had told the former president they felt there had been no evidence of widespread voter fraud that would have had the potential to affect the outcome of the 2020 election \u2014 but that he remained unswayed.\nOne such person was Hope Hicks, who served as a top adviser to Trump for years.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t seeing evidence of fraud on a scale that would have impacted the outcome of the election. And I was becoming increasingly concerned that we were damaging his legacy,\u201d Hicks said, according to a recording of her testimony that was played Monday.\nWhen asked by interviewers in the recording how Trump responded, Hicks replied, \"He said something along the lines of, you know, \u2018Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose, so that won\u2019t matter. The only thing that matters is winning.\u2019\u201d\nRebecca Shabad\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., said then- President Donald Trump \"unlawfully\" tried to overturn the 2020 election results, saying it was a \"premeditated\" effort.\n\"The committee has evidence that ex-President Trump planned to declare victory and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, and that he told numerous allies about his intent in the weeks before the election,\" she said. \nLofgren said the committee found that Trump \"raised hundreds of millions of dollars with false representations made to his online donors.\u00a0The proceeds from this fundraising, we have learned, have been used in ways that we believe are concerning.\"\nThe committee, for example, learned that some of the funds were used to hire lawyers, Lofgren said, adding the panel has evidence of efforts to provide or offer employment to witnesses. \nOne witness's lawyer told the witness that she could \"tell the committee that she didn\u2019t recall facts when she actually did recall them,\" Lofgren said.\n\"That lawyer also did not disclose who was paying for the lawyer\u2019s representation, despite\u00a0questions from the client seeking that information,\" Lofgren said. \nThe lawyer told his client, \"'We\u2019re not telling people where funding is coming from right now,'\" Lofgren added.\nThe committee learned that a client was offered potential employment \"that would make her 'financially very comfortable' as the date of her testimony approached by entities that were apparently linked to Donald Trump and his associates,\" Lofgren said.\u00a0\"These offers were withdrawn or didn\u2019t materialize as reports of the content of her testimony circulated.\"\nLiz Brown-Kaiser\nJan. 6 committee Chair Rep. Bennie Thompson told reporters shortly before beginning the meeting Monday that he had \"no plans\" to speak with special counsel Jack Smith regarding the information that the panel has collected.\nIn November, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Smith, who most recently served as chief prosecutor for the special court in The Hague,\u00a0as special counsel overseeing the Justice Department's investigations into former President Donald Trump, citing in part Trump's announcement that he is running for president.\nSmith is investigating Trump's handling of\u00a0classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago, as well as \u201ckey aspects\u201d of the investigation into\u00a0Trump's role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\nThompson said the committee will send its referrals to the Justice Department \u201cshortly after we take care of business today.\u201d\nSummer Concepcion\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the vice chair of the committee, excoriated former President Donald Trump for refusing to do his duty in ensuring a peaceful transfer of power and for failing to issue a condemnation as the Capitol attack unfolded.\n\u201cAmong the most shameful of this committee\u2019s findings was that President Trump sat in the dining room off the Oval Office watching the violent riot at the Capitol on television,\u201d Cheney said.\nCheney noted that law enforcement agents were under attack and the electoral count was halted as a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\u201cIt was an utter moral failure and a clear dereliction of duty,\u201d Cheney said.\nRebecca Shabad\nFour police officers who defended the Capitol and lawmakers during the riot, and who were critical witnesses to the events of Jan. 6, are in the committee's meeting room watching the final event in person. \nThe four officers are D.C. Officer Daniel Hodges, who was crushed by the mob at the Capitol on Jan. 6; former U.S. Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, who recently resigned from the force; D.C. Police Officer Michael Fanone; and U.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn. \nSummer Concepcion\nIn opening remarks, committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., previewed the timeline for the public release of transcripts of the panel\u2019s hearings as well as its final report.\nThompson said he expects the committee\u2019s final report to be filed with the clerk of the House and made public later this week. The committee is set to outline a number of recommendations in its final report, he said.\nThe committee also intends to release the bulk of its nonsensitive records to the public before the end of the year.\n\u201cThese transcripts and documents will allow the American people to see for themselves the body of evidence we\u2019ve gathered and continue to explore the information that has led us to our conclusions,\u201d Thompson said.\nHe expressed confidence that the work of the committee will \"help provide a roadmap to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we\u2019ve provided to aid their work.\"\nSarah Mimms\nThe Jan. 6 committee has gaveled in for its final public meeting.\nJonathan Allen\nThe Jan. 6 committee really had no other option than to issue criminal referrals for former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, as it plans to do when members meet Monday afternoon.\nOtherwise, lawmakers would have undercut their own votes to impeach Trump for incitement of insurrection in January 2021, one week before he left office. \nIn the article adopted then on a 232-197 vote, the House found that \"Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States.\" Additionally, the article made the specific allegation that Trump obstructed government proceedings, namely the certification of President Joe Biden's victory. \nThe implicit mission of the Jan. 6 committee was to find and publicize evidence that supported claims that Trump acted illegally in his effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election and remain in power.\nThe lawmakers will argue this week that they found that evidence and it requires the Justice Department to act.\n \nMonica Alba, Peter Alexander and Summer Concepcion\nThe White House will be carefully and quietly watching the Jan. 6 Committee\u2019s final public meeting today, multiple officials told NBC News.\nKey aides, however, aren\u2019t expected to provide any formal reaction or weigh in on any of the possible criminal referrals and will likely defer to the Justice Department, these sources say.\nAlthough President Joe Biden has publicly condemned the Capitol attack as a threat to democracy, the administration has intentionally made efforts to avoid any risk of appearing to interfere with any criminal investigation, especially probes in connection to former President Donald Trump. The same case applies this week as the congressional panel wraps up its work, officials said.\nBiden is scheduled to meet with the president of Ecuador this afternoon while the committee\u2019s public hearing gets underway.\nRyan Nobles\nRepublicans plan to release a counter report designed to serve as a rebuttal to the Jan 6 committee\u2019s final report.\nThe group of Republicans who were denied access to the Jan. 6th Select Committee after a squabble between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, are writing their own report that is expected to be more than 100 pages.\nA spokesperson for Rep. Jim Banks, one of the five GOP members who were picked by McCarthy to serve on the committee, told NBC News their report is expected later this week, around the same time the committee\u2019s full report drops.\nRepublicans have been critical of the committee for not focusing enough on the security and intelligence failures around the Capitol leading up to and on Jan. 6. They\u2019ve also suggested the committee lacks a clear legislative purpose.\n\u201cThat just shows me ... that the select committee was less about achieving the goals of the bipartisan commission that I wrote and supported than they were about just getting scoring political points,\u201d said Rep. Rodney Davis, another of the GOP members tapped to serve on the Jan. 6th committee.\u00a0\nAxios was first to report of the GOP plans to counter the Select Committee\u2019s report.\u00a0\nRyan J. Reilly\nThe Justice Department's inspector general said ahead of the Jan. 6 committee's meeting that the office is examining potential \"weaknesses in DOJ protocols, policies, or procedures that adversely affected DOJ\u2019s ability to effectively prepare for and respond to the events at the U.S. Capitol.\"\nIn an annual report on the Justice Department's top management challenges, the inspector general said that its ongoing review of DOJ's preparations for Jan. 6 would also \"address important issues\" emphasized in the Biden administration's National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.\n\u201cAs has long been the case in this arena, the significant hurdle to this strategy is preserving individuals\u2019 First Amendment right to free speech or activity while protecting against the threat to national security,\u201d the report states.\nThe inspector general said domestic terrorism is one of the biggest issues facing the Justice Department, as is strengthening public trust in DOJ. The inspector general said the department faces a \"significant challenge\" in making sure enforcement of the law is even-handed.\n\"Objectivity is equally important in the Department\u2019s exercise of its law enforcement authorities.\u00a0The law enforcement responses to protests in the spring and summer of 2020 at Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C.; Portland, Oregon; and elsewhere, following the deaths of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and others, have been contrasted with the treatment of rioters at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021,\" the report says.\u00a0\n\"The Department faces a significant challenge in ensuring that its law enforcement authority is wielded responsibly and without improper consideration or bias,\" the inspector general said. \"Public accountability and transparency about its actions is necessary to address perceived disparities in law enforcement responses to these events.\"\nAli Vitali, Kate Santaliz, Haley Talbot and Summer Concepcion\nThe Jan. 6 committee intends to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department against Trump lawyer John Eastman,\u00a0a key figure in former President Donald Trump\u2019s challenges to the 2020 election results, two sources familiar with the panel\u2019s deliberations tell NBC News.\nMembers of the committee said during a dress rehearsal overheard by NBC News on Sunday that the panel believed it had sufficient evidence to refer Eastman.\n\u201cOf course, President Trump did not act alone,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., was overheard telling his colleagues Sunday. \u201cThere is significant evidence to the fact that Eastman was part of this conspiracy\u201d and, additionally, \u201cit is now clear that this conspiracy involved many more people other than Dr. Eastman.\u201d\nRaskin also said Eastman was \u201ccentrally involved\u201d in a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results.\nThe committee will likely reveal Eastman\u2019s referrals during Monday\u2019s meeting, in addition to expected criminal referrals for Trump.\nA source familiar with the committee\u2019s plans told NBC News about the committee\u2019s Sunday meeting and its location on the Capitol complex.\nAllie Raffa and Haley Talbot\nThe Jan. 6th committee spent nearly 18 months investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol and the events surrounding it. During that time, the panel:\nDaniel Barnes and Summer Concepcion\nJury selection begins Monday in the trial of Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys, and four other members of the group. Each of them are charged with seditious conspiracy and other felonies for their actions leading up to and on Jan. 6, 2021.\nTarrio is charged along with three other defendants, who are accused of being leaders of their local Proud Boy chapters: Ethan Nordean of Washington, Joseph Biggs of Florida and Zachary Rehl of Pennsylvania. The fifth defendant, Dominic Pezzola, is accused of using a stolen police shield to break a window in the Capitol that allowed rioters to climb inside the building.\nAlthough Tarrio was not physically in D.C. on Jan. 6, prosecutors allege he helped plan the group\u2019s strategy and actions during the Capitol attack.\nJury selection is expected to take place throughout this week before opening statements on Jan. 3.\nSummer Concepcion\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday that the\u00a0House Jan. 6 committee\u00a0has evidence that\u00a0former President Donald Trump\u00a0broke the law, but he declined to get specific about the criminal referrals it will make.\nIn an interview on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Schiff, a member of the committee, cited multiple efforts by Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, including pressuring state officials to go along with his false claims of widespread election fraud. \u201cIf that\u2019s not criminal, then I don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d he said.\nSchiff, however, declined to comment on specific referrals, saying the panel is set to vote on them and will reveal its decision Monday, as well as release its final report later this month.\n\u201cBut I can tell you that our process has been to look meticulously at the evidence and compare it to various statutes. Is there sufficient evidence as to each element of a particular crime?\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not referring, or at least won\u2019t be voting to refer, everyone we think there may be evidence, because we want to focus on those for which we believe there\u2019s the strongest evidence.\u201d\nRead more here.\nAli Vitali, Kate Santaliz and Haley Talbot\nThe House Jan. 6 committee met Sunday to finalize its plans to issue at least three criminal referrals for former President Donald Trump, NBC News learned exclusively.\nThe committee is expected to vote on referrals asking the Justice Department to pursue at least three criminal charges against Trump related to the Capitol riot: obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the government and inciting or assisting an insurrection.\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said in part during the meeting overheard by NBC News that he believed referrals were \u201cwarranted.\u201d A source familiar with the committee\u2019s plans told NBC News about the meeting and its location on the Capitol complex.\nThe criminal referrals carry no official legal weight, and it remains up to the Justice Department to decide whether or not to charge Trump and anyone else the committee might refer.\nThe committee also plans to refer several Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee for their defiance of congressional subpoenas, NBC News has learned.\nRead more here.\n\u00a9\u00a02023 NBC UNIVERSAL","30":"By\u00a0\n\n\n      Meg Anderson\n    \n\n,\u00a0\n\n\n      Nick McMillan\n    \n\n\n                A selection of the 1000 people who have been charged for the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol in 2021.\n                \n                    \n                    Getty Images and Department of Justice\n                    \n                \nhide caption\n\nA selection of the 1000 people who have been charged for the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol in 2021.\nMore than two years after rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol, prosecutors have now charged more than 1,000 people in relation to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack.\nThese hundreds of people encompass \"the most wide-ranging investigation\" in the history of the Justice Department. NPR has been tracking every case related to the attack as they move through the court system, from the initial arrest to sentencing.\nThe investigation has been a massive undertaking, both in its scope and cost. Every U.S. Attorney's office has been involved, as well as every FBI field office. As part of the $1.7 trillion government spending package passed in December, $2.6 billion was allocated to the U.S. Attorneys, in part to support the Jan. 6 prosecutions.\nIn order to bring charges, the Justice Department is sifting through mountains of evidence and chasing down tips. The FBI says it has been reviewing almost four million files, including 30,000 video files. Those include police body-worn camera footage from five different law enforcement agencies, surveillance footage from the building, as well as the many videos on seized cell phones and posted online.\n\"For context, these files amount to over nine terabytes of information and would take at least 361 days to view continuously,\" the FBI reported when it marked the attack's second anniversary.\nThe sprawling investigation has already doubled the FBI's domestic terrorism caseload, yet the Justice Department has indicated that it believes around 2,000 people were involved in the attack. In other words, the department may not even be halfway through its investigation.\nThe defendants \u2013 who came from nearly all 50 states \u2013 are a tough group to generalize. Most of them appear to be white men, though not entirely.\nAbout 15% of the defendants have a background in the military or law enforcement. For context, about 7% of the U.S. population are military veterans. Police and sheriff patrol officers make up less than 1% of the population.\nThe difficulty in categorizing this group has caused some experts concern. One in four defendants are facing assault or some other violent charge, yet the vast majority of people facing charges \u2013 nearly 85% \u2013 do not have any known connection to extremist groups.\n\"It's not like they all had previous convictions for violence or this kind of long running history of violent assault against political individuals or law enforcement. They were just willing to commit violence on that day,\" says Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism. \"They truly thought the election was stolen. They truly thought that was their day in the sun, that they were the patriots. They were the heroes of that story.\"\n\"It's not just the scary Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. Communities are learning that one does not have to be so far gone, and such a follower of extremist movements, to still be animated to some pretty dangerous efforts to undermine our democracy,\" adds Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. \"Does that mean extremism is becoming mainstream, which sounds a little bit like an oxymoron? Does it mean that the in-roads, the agendas, of those who are the farthest, most extreme, are now becoming normalized? I think the answer is yes.\"\nNearly all of these cases are being heard by 21 judges in the federal district court in Washington, D.C. They were appointed by presidents from both parties from President Reagan to President Biden.\nIt's difficult to compare the rulings of judges because every case is different, but there are common themes in what the judges have been saying to the defendants before them. For one, the judges aren't looking at these crimes in isolation. The significance of Jan. 6, as an attempt to undermine democracy, is playing a part.\n\"The defendant was an active participant in a mob assault on our core democratic values and our cherished institution,\" Judge John Bates, appointed by President George W. Bush, told Thomas Fee. \"I cannot ignore that, cannot pull this misdemeanor out of that context.\"\n\"What happened that day was, in some ways, as serious... an offense as there can be, given that it threatened the peaceful transfer of power from one president to another. The damage that was done on that day was both tangible and intangible,\" Judge Timothy Kelly, appointed by President Trump, said while sentencing Tam Dinh Pham. \"Without people like you, the collective force of the mob that day would not have been the same.\"\nThe judges have also emphasized that being \"sucked into a vortex of misinformation\" does not absolve someone of their actions.\n\"No one was swept away to the Capitol. No one was carried. The rioters were adults,\" Judge Amy Berman Jackson, appointed by President Obama, told Russell James Peterson. \"This defendant, like hundreds of others, walked there on his own two feet and he bears responsibility for his own actions. There may be others who bear greater responsibility and who also must be held accountable, but this is not their day in court, it is yours.\"\nJudges are also interested in accountability \u2014 and whether or not a defendant has made an authentic expression of remorse. That seems to be in part because some of the judges do worry this could happen again.\n\"Every day we're hearing about reports of anti-democratic factions of people plotting violence, the potential threat of violence, in 2024,\" Judge Tanya Chutkan, appointed by Obama, said while sentencing Robert Palmer. \"It has to be made clear that trying to violently overthrow the government, trying to stop the peaceful transition of power and assaulting law enforcement officers in that effort is going to be met with absolutely certain punishment. Not staying at home. Not watching Netflix. Not doing what you were doing before you got arrested.\"\n\"If people start to get the impression that you can do what happened on Jan. 6, you can associate yourself with that behavior and that there's no real consequence, then people will say why not do it again,\" Judge Reggie Walton, appointed by President George W. Bush, told Mariposa Castro.\nDespite the harsh words delivered at sentencing, the judges collectively have actually given less prison time than what prosecutors have sought in around two thirds of the cases. For sentences through February of this year, there have only been six cases in which judges sentenced defendants to prison time even if prosecutors had not sought it. Chutkan, who has given time behind bars in every Jan. 6 case she's heard, was the judge in four of those cases.\nMore than half of the people sentenced to longer prison terms, such as two or more years, have been convicted of assault or injuring others.\nThe defendants who haven't received any prison time are often fined, and sentenced to a combination of probation, community service and home confinement, depending on the nature of the case. The vast majority of these defendants are charged only with \"parading or demonstrating in a Capitol building,\" which is a misdemeanor.\nThere are still major efforts to rewrite history, including from members of Congress who have repeatedly claimed Jan. 6 was not as violent as it clearly was. Just this month, House Republicans announced plans to \"reinvestigate\" Jan. 6.\nMary McCord, executive director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown Law, says she doesn't worry about another attack on the Capitol itself, but says we're perhaps in a worse position now than we were before the insurrection.\n\"That's because it didn't end after Jan. 6,\" she says. \"Those people are still out there eating this up and consuming this. And not all of them saw Jan. 6 as, 'Oh my gosh. Wow. Okay, boy, now I realize democracy is at stake here. I'm going to shake this off and I'm going to quit ingesting this kind of disinformation.' That's not what we saw at all. We saw a doubling down. And it's made worse because elected officials, elected officials at high levels in Congress and in the states, have doubled down.\"\nThere have been federal efforts to combat anti-democratic sentiment. Late last year, the bipartisan House Select Committee issued its final report on Jan. 6, ultimately concluding that Trump was at least in part responsible for the riot and recommending him and others for prosecution. That report is now in the hands of U.S. special counsel Jack Smith at the Justice Department, who is tasked with investigating the former president.\nLewis, of George Washington University, says holding the rioters on Jan. 6 accountable for their actions that day is necessary, but he says we also need to hold responsible the leaders who got all those people to the Capitol that day in the first place.\n\"A lot of it now does come down to the special counsel and to the DOJ more broadly to recognize that if you're just going to keep arresting, you know, the 925th guy who just walked into the Capitol, took some photos and walked out, it risks missing the forest for the trees,\" he says. \"It's just becoming whack a mole at a certain point.\"\nNPR's Barrie Hardymon edited this story for radio and digital, and NPR's Barbara Van Woerkom contributed research.\nSponsor Message\nBecome an NPR sponsor","31":"Credit Cards\nLoans\nBanking\nMortgages\nInsurance\nCredit Monitoring\nPersonal Finance\nSmall Business\nTaxes\nHelp for Low Credit Scores\nInvesting\nSELECT\nAll Credit Cards\nFind the Credit Card for You\nBest Credit Cards\nBest Rewards Credit Cards\nBest Travel Credit Cards\nBest 0% APR Credit Cards\nBest Balance Transfer Credit Cards\nBest Cash Back Credit Cards\nBest Credit Card Welcome Bonuses\nBest Credit Cards to Build Credit\nSELECT\nAll Loans\nFind the Best Personal Loan for You\nBest Personal Loans\nBest Debt Consolidation Loans\nBest Loans to Refinance Credit Card Debt\nBest Loans with Fast Funding\nBest Small Personal Loans\nBest Large Personal Loans\nBest Personal Loans to Apply Online\nBest Student Loan Refinance\nSELECT\nAll Banking\nFind the Savings Account for You\nBest High Yield Savings Accounts\nBest Big Bank Savings Accounts\nBest Big Bank Checking Accounts\nBest No Fee Checking Accounts\nNo Overdraft Fee Checking Accounts\nBest Checking Account Bonuses\nBest Money Market Accounts\nBest CDs\nBest Credit Unions\nSELECT\nAll Mortgages\nBest Mortgages\nBest Mortgages for Small Down Payment\nBest Mortgages for No Down Payment\nBest Mortgages with No Origination Fee\nBest Mortgages for Average Credit Score\nAdjustable Rate Mortgages\nAffording a Mortgage\nSELECT\nAll Insurance\nBest Life Insurance\nBest Homeowners Insurance\nBest Renters Insurance\nBest Car Insurance\nTravel Insurance\nSELECT\nAll Credit Monitoring\nBest Credit Monitoring Services\nBest Identity Theft Protection\nHow to Boost Your Credit Score\nCredit Repair Services\nSELECT\nAll Personal Finance\nBest Budgeting Apps\nBest Expense Tracker Apps\nBest Money Transfer Apps\nBest Resale Apps and Sites\nBuy Now Pay Later (BNPL) Apps\nBest Debt Relief\nSELECT\nAll Small Business\nBest Small Business Savings Accounts\nBest Small Business Checking Accounts\nBest Credit Cards for Small Business\nBest Small Business Loans\nBest Tax Software for Small Business\nSELECT\nAll Taxes\nBest Tax Software\nBest Tax Software for Small Businesses\nTax Refunds\nSELECT\nAll Help for Low Credit Scores\nBest Credit Cards for Bad Credit\nBest Personal Loans for Bad Credit\nBest Debt Consolidation Loans for Bad Credit\nPersonal Loans if You Don't Have Credit\nBest Credit Cards for Building Credit\nPersonal Loans for 580 Credit Score or Lower\nPersonal Loans for 670 Credit Score or Lower\nBest Mortgages for Bad Credit\nBest Hardship Loans\nHow to Boost Your Credit Score\nSELECT\nAll Investing\nBest IRA Accounts\nBest Roth IRA Accounts\nBest Investing Apps\nBest Free Stock Trading Platforms\nBest Robo-Advisors\nIndex Funds\nMutual Funds\nETFs\nBonds\n\nFormer President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he has been told he is a target in the Jan. 6 criminal investigation by special counsel Jack Smith.\nTrump is the leading contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

The prosecutors said the order would also shield any \"sensitive and confidential\" information included in discovery from public view.\nTrump's lawyers were denied an extension over the weekend to get more time to respond to the motion for a protective order.\nNegotiating the parameters of this protective order is a crucial step for prosecutors before they can begin the all-important discovery process and nail down a time for an actual trial.\nIn their response to the Trump legal team's proposal, federal prosecutors reiterated their support for a broader protective order, saying it would \"safeguard witness privacy and the integrity of these proceedings.\"\nThe filings late Monday showed just how far apart the two sides are on the issue. \nTrump's team included a correspondence between the defense and prosecutors that seemed to emphasize that point. An email from prosecutors in court filings said: \"We have had a chance to review it and do not believe we will be able to come to an agreement on most issues.\"\nThe government's suggested order would apply to all discovery produced by prosecutors, which \"is consistent with others routinely entered in criminal cases in this District,\" lawyers for the Justice Department wrote. \n\"The defendant's proposed order would lead to the public dissemination of discovery material. Indeed, that is the defendant's stated goal; the defendant seeks to use the discovery material to litigate this case in the media,\" prosecutors wrote. \"But that is contrary to the purpose of criminal discovery, which is to afford defendants the ability to prepare for and mount a defense in court \u2014 not to wage a media campaign.\"\nOn Trump and his attorneys' claim that such an order would impede on his First Amendment rights, the prosecutors said, \"There is no right to publicly release discovery material.\"\nJudge Tanya Chutkan will decide next steps on the protective order.

They appeared to be coming from the southwest of the city.\u00a0\nIt's now just past 6:30 a.m. in Kyiv. Earlier this morning, CNN teams on the ground reported hearing large blasts in the city.\nIn a tweet early Friday morning, Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba decried the \"horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv.\"\n\n\nCNN teams in Kyiv reported hearing blasts early Friday morning. \nUkraine's Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Yenin attributed an explosion Friday to a Ukrainian \"anti-missile system shooting a (Russian) missile out of the sky.\" CNN has not been able to independently verify this. \nFrom CNN's Tim Lister in Kyiv\nThe Ukrainian Defense Ministry says its armed forces have inflicted some 800 casualties on Russian forces since the invasion began in the early hours of Thursday.\nIt was not immediately clear whether the ministry was referring solely to the number killed.\nThe ministry said more than 30 Russian tanks had been destroyed, as well as seven Russian aircraft and six helicopters.\nCNN is not able to independently verify Ukraine's figures.\nFrom CNN\u2019s Hira Humayun\nThe European Union announced new sanctions on Russia early Friday that would target the country's financial, energy and transport sectors, visa policy, and include export controls and export financing bans.\nThe sanctions will have \"maximum impact on the Russian economy and political elite,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. \u201cWe will hold the Kremlin accountable,\u201d she said.\nShe said the financial sanctions cut Russia\u2019s most important capital markets, and that they are now targeting 70% of the Russian banking market and key state-owned companies.

It suggests the author anticipated a rapid victory and the piece was published prematurely.\nThe article, published by the state-owned RIA-Novosti news agency on Saturday (26 February) and described by Christo Grozev of fact-checkers Bellingcat as \"extremely shocking, even for Kremlin standards\", was quickly deleted from its website.\nOther Twitter users called it Russia's \"victory celebration\".\nHowever, it still remains visible on the Internet Archive website, and at the time of writing it's also visible on a regional page of Russia's government-owned Sputnik news site.\nA syndicated version in English entitled \"The New World Order\" can also be seen on the website of Pakistan's Frontier Post.\nMany Twitter users presumed the editorial piece was intended for publication after a swift Russian victory in Ukraine.\nIn it, contributor Petr Akopov claims that Russia is returning to lead a new world order, while making good the \"terrible catastrophe\" that was the end of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nIt is headlined \"The arrival of Russia in a new world\", but the Russian word for \"arrival\" (nastuplenie) can also mean \"attack\".\nMr Akopov justifies the \"virtual civil war\" as \"Russia restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together\".\nMoscow is drawing together \"Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians (Ukrainians)\", he says, suggesting a Russian plan to increase its sphere of influence.\nThe architect of this act of reunion is, of course, Mr Putin, who is praised for taking action now, rather than leaving the situation to be resolved in the future.\n\"Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations,\" the article says.\nIt concludes by claiming that the military action \"is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world\", which has put the Anglo-Saxons of Europe and the US in their place.\n\"Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over,\" it claims.\nSome claims on social media say that the timing of the article's publication - exactly 08:00 on Saturday - shows that it was planned in advance by those who thought that the war would reach a swift conclusion.\nThe publication of this article marks a change of Russian tone on the invasion in the country's state-controlled media, mentioning its motivation of returning Ukraine to \"its natural state as part of the Russian world\".\nBut with the invasion seemingly going much slower than expected, this new narrative looks like it's been quietly shelved.\nInstead, state-run media in Russia continues to tell its audiences that the invasion is a \"special military operation\" to support the Russian-backed rebels in the east of Ukraine, and to \"de-Nazify\" the country.\nThere's virtually no mention of casualties or military setbacks, while large chunks of TV schedules on state channels are given over to talk shows justifying military action.\nOnly relatively small outlets with very small audiences are reporting the reality of events, while Russia's media regulator Roskomnadzor has restricted Russian users' access to Facebook and Twitter, in what it says is a protest against \"censorship\" by the social media platforms. \nSenate Republicans blocked a $110bn aid package for Ukraine, Israel and aid for Gaza.\nThe BBC has seen evidence of foreigners without valid visas being sent to a military camp near Ukraine.\nPolice say they believe the 14-year-old girl may have been involved in a conflict with classmates.\nThe FSB state security service is accused of hacking and releasing sensitive documents.\nKathmandu has asked Moscow to return all Nepali mercenaries after six of them were killed.\nCopyright 2023 BBC.

By the way, Gazprom was allowed to inspect the\u00a0site\u00a0of the explosion,\"\u00a0Putin told journalists at a\u00a0news conference following meetings with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Russian city of Sochi.\nPutin described how the pipe that was torn out was \u201cbent at 90 degrees and thrown as far as 40 meters to the side, just in the direction of Nord Stream 2, which also turned out to be damaged, apparently by this explosion and fragments, the remains of this pipe.\"\n\"So this is an obvious terrorist attack, and it's hard for us to control it, because it's all in the special economic zone of Denmark, Sweden, then beyond Germany,\" the Russian president said. \nMore background: In September, European countries raced to investigate unexplained leaks in two Russian gas pipelines running under the Baltic Sea near Sweden and Denmark.\u00a0\nBoth pipelines have been flashpoints in an escalating energy war between European capitals and Moscow that has pummelled major Western economies, sent gas prices soaring and sparked a hunt for alternative energy supplies.\nFrom CNN\u2019s Katharina Krebs and Sugam Pokharel \n\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Moscow's fresh onslaught on Ukraine earlier in the day was partly in response to the attack on Russia's fleet in the Crimean city of Sevastopol on Saturday, which he blamed on Kyiv.\nWhen asked by a reporter if Monday's strikes were a response to Saturday's drone attacks in Crimea, Putin said: \nRussia launched missile attacks on infrastructure facilities in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, leaving parts of the capital without electricity and water.\u00a0\nWhen asked about the possibility of peace talks with Ukraine, Putin said: \"In order to start making proposals at the talks, the talks need to take place first. And laying out your negotiating position on the table in advance is not always advisable in order to achieve your national goals.\"\u00a0\n\"But in order to achieve agreements, you need to sit down at the negotiating table and negotiate,\" he added.\nThe Russian leader blamed Ukraine for throwing \"in the bin\" the agreement reached in Istanbul earlier this year while signing the Black Sea grain export deal.\u00a0\n\"And now, in general, they forbid themselves to talk with us. Well, how can we now discuss possible agreements if there is not even a desire on the other side to talk to us? We will wait, maybe some necessary conditions will ripen. And our goodwill is known \u2014 it is not subject to any changes and doubts,\" he added.\u00a0\nFrom CNN\u2019s Katharina Krebs and Sugam Pokharel in London\nPresident Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Russia was suspending but \u201cnot ending\u201d its participation in the vital Black Sea grain export deal with Ukraine.\nRussia's decision came after \"the creation of a threat\" to the humanitarian corridor, Putin said at a news conference following meetings with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan in the southern Russian city of Sochi.\nRussia on Saturday announced that it was suspending its involvement in the UN-brokered agreement viewed as key to addressing the global food shortage. \nMoscow said it was leaving the deal after blaming Ukraine for a drone attack on Crimea on Saturday. Kyiv accused Russia of inventing \u201cfictitious terrorist attacks\u201d and using the deal as \u201cblackmail.\u201d\n\u201cThe whole process of exporting grain from Ukraine's territory was organized under the pretext of ensuring the interests of the poorest countries. And we did this precisely in the interests of the poorest countries,\" Putin said.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript for a better experience.","36":"Live\nIsrael-Hamas war\nLive\nGOP debate highlights\nBy Tara Subramaniam, Jack Guy, Ed Upright, Adrienne Vogt, Aditi Sangal and Maureen Chowdhury, CNN\nOur live coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine has moved here.\nFrom CNN's Jonny Hallam\nPresident Volodymyr\u00a0Zelensky\u00a0said Russia demanding security guarantees from Ukraine demonstrates the failure of its invasion after eight months of fighting.\nIn his nightly address on Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader said: \"252 days ago, Russia demanded security guarantees from the United States of America.\u00a0After eight months of Russia's so-called 'special operation,' the Kremlin is demanding security guarantees from Ukraine. These are indeed striking changes.\"\u00a0\n\"It shows both the failure of Russian aggression and how strong we are when we remain united,\" Zelensky added.\nEarlier on Wednesday,\u00a0Russia resumed its participation in the UN-brokered grain deal that it had left days earlier, saying it had received written security guarantees from Ukraine on demilitarizing the maritime corridor.\nIn televised comments,\u00a0Russian President Vladimir Putin\u00a0said, \u201chaving received the necessary\u00a0guarantees\u00a0from the Ukrainian side that the humanitarian route will not be used for military purposes, Russia resumes the implementation of the grain deal.\"\u00a0\nFrom CNN's Jennifer Hansler\nThe Biden administration approved the potential sale of approximately $535 million in Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems to Finland, the State Department announced Wednesday.\nThe approval comes as Finland awaits approval by Turkey and Hungary to join NATO. Helsinki\u2019s move to join the defense alliance was prompted by Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine \u2014 Finland shares shares an 800-mile border with Russia.\u00a0\n\u201cFinland intends to use these defense articles and services to increase its national stock, bolstering the land and air defense capabilities in Europe\u2019s northern flank,\u201d it said. \u201cThe increased national stock is critical to Finland\u2019s defense and deterrence due to the deteriorated security situation in Europe.\u201d\u00a0\nFrom CNN's Julia Kesaieva\nUkrainian officials say that the military has struck an important target in the southern region Kherson, as the pro-Russian authorities continue to press civilians to leave.\nSerhii Khlan, member of the Kherson Regional Council, said that Ukrainian forces hit Russian air defense systems close to the stadium in Kherson city. Those systems have also been used to shell Mykolaiv, sometimes with devastating effect.\nKhlan posted a photograph purportedly showing the \"remains of the equipment.\"\nKhlan said there had also been further hits in the area of the Antonivskyi bridge, where Russian forces and the pro-Russian administration have been operating ferries and pontoon bridges to resupply the west bank, where thousands of Russian troops remain.\nHe said that in the city of Kakhovka \u2014on the east bank of the river Dnipro \u2014 the three streets closest to the river were being forcibly evacuated. He said the Russians \"in the city are digging in, setting up concrete trenches.\"\nKhlan said the Russians \"are digging in on the east bank, preparing for defense, thinking that this make our offensive impossible. But the resistance movement and the Armed Forces of\u00a0Ukraine\u00a0continue to fight.\"\nKhlan repeated what other Ukrainian officials have asserted: that the Russian-backed authorities have left the city of Kherson \u2014\u00a0which is on the west bank \u2014\u00a0to set up office in the city of Skadovsk, much closer to Crimea.\u00a0\n\"As for the urgent and mandatory \"evacuation\" called for by the Russians, our people are not going to go anywhere.

Jonny Hallam and Olga Voitovych\u00a0\n\n\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro\u00a0Kuleba said Iran has been informed through diplomatic channels of the consequences of Tehran sending new weapon deliveries of attack drones and ballistic missiles to Russia.\u00a0\nKuleba said at a news conference in Kyiv that \"the threat is real\" of reported new weapon deliveries from Iran. \nOn Tuesday, CNN reported that Iran is preparing to send approximately 1,000 additional weapons, including surface-to-surface short range ballistic missiles and\u00a0more attack drones, to Russia to use in its war against Ukraine, according to officials from a Western country that closely monitors Iran\u2019s weapons program.\n\"A much wiser decision for Iran would be to completely curtail its military cooperation, supply to Russia of any weapons used against Ukraine,\" Kuleba added.\u00a0\nIran has repeatedly denied sending weapons to Russia despite clear evidence to the contrary.\u00a0\nFrom CNN's Yulia Kesaieva\nUkrainian President Volodymyr\u00a0Zelensky\u00a0on Wednesday said he thanked Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan for his \"active participation in preserving the grain deal\" after Russia said it would rejoin the agreement.\nZelensky\u00a0said in a Telegram post that during the phone call with\u00a0Erdo\u011fan, he also thanked his\u00a0Turkish counterpart for his \"strong support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.\"\nZelensky said that they also discussed\u00a0\"further steps for the return of our captured political prisoners.\"\n\"Turkey's support is important for us in this matter,\" he added.\u00a0\nFrom CNN's Jonny Hallam\nRussia on Wednesday said its nuclear doctrine\u00a0will only permit the use of\u00a0atomic weapons in a way that is\u00a0defensive in nature and\u00a0that the strict guidelines \"pursue solely defensive goals.\"\nA statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation said the Russian military is \"strictly and consistently\u00a0guided by the tenet that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\"\n\"Russian doctrinal approaches in this sphere are defined with utmost accuracy\" and do not allow room for \"expansive interpretation,\" the ministry said.\nThe statement comes amid a recent increase in concern among United States and Western officials that Russia was considering using a tactical nuclear weapon on Ukraine.\nOn Wednesday, CNN reported that\u00a0Russian military officials have discussed how and under what conditions Russia would use a tactical nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine, according to a US intelligence assessment described to CNN by multiple sources who have read it.\nThe Russian foreign ministry in its statement said that it reaffirms its commitment to a joint statement signed on Jan. 3 by China, Russia, France, the UK and the US on preventing nuclear war and arms races. \n\"We urge other states of the 'nuclear five' to demonstrate in practice their willingness to work on solving this top-priority task and to give up the dangerous attempts to infringe on vital interests of each other while balancing on the brink of a direct armed conflict and encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction, which can lead to catastrophic consequences,\" the ministry said.\nFrom CNN's Eve Brennan and Chris Liakos\u00a0\n\n\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres \u201cwarmly welcomes\u201d Russia resuming participation in the Black Sea grain deal, his spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric said on

facilitate the safe navigation for exports of grain, foodstuffs and fertilizer from Ukraine,\u201d Dujarric said in a news release.\nDujarric said that Guterres is \u201cgrateful\u201d for the diplomatic efforts of Turkey, thanking \u201cUN Coordinator, Amir Abdulla, and his team for their work to keep this vital food supply line open.\u201d\n\u201cThe Secretary-General continues his engagement with all actors towards the renewal and full implementation of the Initiative, and he also remains committed to removing the remaining obstacles to the exports of Russian food and fertilizer,\u201d Dujarric added.\u00a0\u00a0\nFrom CNN's Natasha Bertrand, Katie Bo Lillis and Zachary Cohen\n\n\nRussian military officials have discussed how and under what conditions Russia would use a tactical nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine, according to a US intelligence assessment described to CNN by multiple sources who have read it.\nThe assessment, drafted by the National Intelligence Council, is not a high confidence product and is not raw intelligence but rather analysis, multiple people who have read it told CNN. For that reason, some officials believe the conversations reflected in the document may have been taken out of context, and do not necessarily indicate that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon.\nThe US has still not seen any signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to take the drastic step of using one, officials said, and Putin is not believed to have been involved in the discussions described in the NIC product.\nBut others within the administration who have viewed the document have reacted with concern, because it provides a rare window into conversations between senior Russian generals and reveals their intensifying frustration about Russia's losses on the battlefield in Ukraine. That frustration could turn into desperation, some officials fear. There are also questions about whether Russia's self-declared annexation of eastern Ukraine earlier this year means Russia is willing to take more extreme measures to protect that territory.\nSome more context: The US has also been watching Russia's actions around the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, which Ukrainian forces are trying to take back from Russian forces in a counteroffensive. In recent weeks, Russian officials have ordered the city to be evacuated, and the US is concerned that if Ukraine drives the Russians out in a humiliating defeat, it could be the kind of trigger that would lead Putin to resort to tactical nukes. It's among the scenarios envisioned by the intelligence assessment, although officials emphasized that Kherson is not the sole focus of the product.\nThe New York Times first reported on the intelligence assessment. But the internal divisions over the quality of the intelligence and how to interpret it has not been previously reported.\nCNN's Barbara Starr contributed to this report. \nRead more about this here.\nPlease enable JavaScript for a better experience.","37":"Credit Cards\nLoans\nBanking\nMortgages\nInsurance\nCredit Monitoring\nPersonal Finance\nSmall Business\nTaxes\nHelp for Low Credit Scores\nInvesting\nSELECT\nAll Credit Cards\nFind the Credit Card for You\nBest Credit Cards\nBest Rewards Credit Cards\nBest Travel Credit Cards\nBest 0% APR Credit Cards\nBest Balance Transfer Credit Cards\nBest Cash Back Credit Cards\nBest Credit Card Welcome Bonuses\nBest Credit Cards to Build Credit\nSELECT\nAll Loans\nFind the Best Personal Loan for You\nBest Personal Loans\nBest Debt Consolidation Loans\nBest Loans to Refinance Credit Card Debt\nBest Loans with Fast Funding\nBest Small Personal Loans\nBest Large Personal Loans\nBest Personal Loans to Apply Online\nBest Student Loan Refinance\nSELECT\nAll Banking\nFind the Savings Account for You\nBest High Yield Savings Accounts\nBest Big Bank Savings Accounts\nBest Big Bank Checking Accounts\nBest No Fee Checking Accounts\nNo Overdraft Fee Checking Accounts\nBest Checking Account Bonuses\nBest Money Market Accounts\nBest CDs\nBest Credit Unions\nSELECT\nAll Mortgages\nBest Mortgages\nBest Mortgages for Small Down Payment\nBest Mortgages for No Down Payment\nBest Mortgages with No Origination Fee\nBest Mortgages for Average Credit Score\nAdjustable Rate Mortgages\nAffording a Mortgage\nSELECT\nAll Insurance\nBest Life Insurance\nBest Homeowners Insurance\nBest Renters Insurance\nBest Car Insurance\nTravel Insurance\nSELECT\nAll Credit Monitoring\nBest Credit Monitoring Services\nBest Identity Theft Protection\nHow to Boost Your Credit Score\nCredit Repair Services\nSELECT\nAll Personal Finance\nBest Budgeting Apps\nBest Expense Tracker Apps\nBest Money Transfer Apps\nBest Resale Apps and Sites\nBuy Now Pay Later (BNPL) Apps\nBest Debt Relief\nSELECT\nAll Small Business\nBest Small Business Savings Accounts\nBest Small Business Checking Accounts\nBest Credit Cards for Small Business\nBest Small Business Loans\nBest Tax Software for Small Business\nSELECT\nAll Taxes\nBest Tax Software\nBest Tax Software for Small Businesses\nTax Refunds\nSELECT\nAll Help for Low Credit Scores\nBest Credit Cards for Bad Credit\nBest Personal Loans for Bad Credit\nBest Debt Consolidation Loans for Bad Credit\nPersonal Loans if You Don't Have Credit\nBest Credit Cards for Building Credit\nPersonal Loans for 580 Credit Score or Lower\nPersonal Loans for 670 Credit Score or Lower\nBest Mortgages for Bad Credit\nBest Hardship Loans\nHow to Boost Your Credit Score\nSELECT\nAll Investing\nBest IRA Accounts\nBest Roth IRA Accounts\nBest Investing Apps\nBest Free Stock Trading Platforms\nBest Robo-Advisors\nIndex Funds\nMutual Funds\nETFs\nBonds\n\nThis has been CNBC's live blog covering updates on the war in Ukraine. [Follow the latest updates here.]\nUkraine's power shortages, resulting from Russia's repeated strikes on the country's energy infrastructure, are becoming more acute as colder weather sets in.\nWarning that \"cold weather can kill,\" the World Health Organization said while 10 million Ukrainians remain without power, many face life-threatening conditions as temperatures fall \u2014 to as low as -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. It is believed that another two to three million people could leave their homes to find warmth and safety over winter.\nThe recently de-occupied city of Kherson is feeling power and water shortages acutely, with Ukrainian officials telling residents, and particularly women, children and the elderly and vulnerable, to leave the city and de-occupied parts of the wider Kherson region over winter. \nThe government is offering free evacuation to Kryvyi Rih, Mykolaiv and Odesa, with possible further movement to Kirovohrad, Khmelnytskyi or western regions of Ukraine, Ukraine's deputy prime minister said Monday.\nThe Treasury Department issued new guidance regarding the maritime transport of Russian oil ahead of a planned price cap in early December.\nThe guidance complements the U.K.'s newly-released policies in outlining how domestic service providers can continue carrying seaborne oil while complying with the strategic price cap on Russian oil devised by G7 countries, the E.U. and Australia. \n\"We're taking these steps to make it as easy as possible for market participants to implement the price cap policy as of Dec. 5 consistent with the coalition's goals of allowing Russians to keep foreign oil (in) flow while lowering the Kremlin's revenues,\" a senior Treasury official said.\nThe price cap is intended to deprive Russia of a funding source to continue its war against Ukraine. It goes into effect on Dec. 5.\n\u2014Chelsey Cox\nThe European Union has sent another $2.5 billion to help Ukraine, according to the country's prime minister, Denys Shmyhal.\nShmyhal said in a tweet on Tuesday that the EU \"disbursed \u20ac2.5 billion [around $2.57 billion] in macro-financial assistance.\"\nTweet:\nThe massive infusion of cash is the latest effort by the EU to help Ukraine fight off the Russian invasion. \nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently announced that the EU will provide up to $18 billion in financial aid in 2023 as the country takes on Russia.\n- Brian Schwartz\nIran may be guilty of crimes against humanity as a result of producing weapons for Russia that reportedly will be used in Ukraine, said British Ambassador to the U.S. Karen Pierce in an interview.\n\"Even at this late stage, I do think the Iranians need to contemplate how they may be guilty of crimes against humanity by supplying these weapons to the Russians,\" Pierce told Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC.\nThe Washington Post reported that Iran has agreed to start to manufacture hundreds of unmanned drones on Russian soil.\nIt is expected that those weapons to be used in the conflict with Ukraine.\n- Brian Schwartz\nA bipartisan group of 16 senators asked the Biden administration to reverse its decision against sending advanced drones to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion.\u00a0\nIn a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the senators argued that the U.S. should provide Ukraine with MQ-1C Grey Eagles, armed drones that can fly for more than 24 hours at a time. \nThe senators wrote that they believe these drones will help stabilize Ukrainian defenses, increase their unmanned capabilities and drive the war in Ukraine's favor.\nUkraine's request for drones was declined by the Pentagon earlier this month.\n\"This system's operational attributes \u2013 availability, lethality, survivability, and exportability \u2013 complement existing weapon systems used by the Ukrainians and will increase the lethality of the Ukrainian military,\" the lawmakers wrote.\u00a0\nThey requested an official response from the Biden administration by Nov. 30.\n\u2014 Ashley Capoot\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen praised an additional disbursement of $4.5 billion from the U.S. government to aid Ukraine in its ongoing defense against Russia.\nThe disbursement brings total U.S. direct budget support to $13 billion in grants, Yellen said in a statement. \nShe said that the aid, in combination with historic sanctions and other targeted measures, will help \"weaken [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war machine.\"\nThe funds will begin being disbursed \"in the coming weeks and help the Government of Ukraine defend against Russia's illegal war\u00a0by bolstering economic stability and supporting core government services, including wages for hospital workers, government employees, and teachers as well as social assistance for the elderly and vulnerable,\" she said in her statement.\n\"Combined with our security assistance and the immense bravery of the Ukrainian people, these funds are a critical tool in Ukraine's resistance to Putin's unprovoked invasion,\" Yellen said.\n\u2014Chelsey Cox\nThe Associated Press fired national security reporter James LaPorta over a retracted article that incorrectly had said Russian missiles were responsible for the deaths of two people in neighboring Poland, The Daily Beast reported.\nThe Nov. 15 story had circulated widely among media outlets before the AP issued a correction Wednesday, which reported that the deaths in the Polish town of Przewodow near the Ukraine border in reality involved Russian-made missiles which were fired by Ukraine in defense against Russia. \nA Russian attack on Poland, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, could have prompted intervention from NATO in the Russian-Ukraine conflict. \nThe initial missile claim by LaPorta had been attributed to \"a senior U.S. intelligence official.\" \nThe AP says it requires more than one source when sourcing is anonymous unless \"material comes from an authoritative figure who provides information so detailed that there is no question of its accuracy.\"\nInternal communications showed some confusion over who approved LaPorta's source, The Washington Post reported.\nLaPorta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC. Lauren Easton, vice president of corporate communications for the AP, did not answer directly when asked if LaPorta had been terminated. \nEaston said in a statement that the news service outlet abided by \"rigorous editorial standards and practices\" critical to its mission. \n\"When our standards are violated, we must take the steps necessary to protect the integrity of the news report. We do not make these decisions lightly, nor are they based on isolated incidents,\" she said.\n\u2014Chelsey Cox\nThe head of Ukraine's national power grid said that the damage left by Russia's missile attacks has devasted the nation's power generation capacity.\n\"The scale of destruction is colossal. In Ukraine, there is a power generation deficit. We cannot generate as much energy as consumers can use,\" said Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, CEO of Ukrenergo National Energy Company, \nKudrytskyi said that a recent massive missile attack by Russia on the nation's power grids was the  \"biggest one in Ukrainian history.\"\n\"More than 100 heavy missiles were launched at the Ukrainian power grid infrastructure,\" he said.\nThe Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid have left many regions of the country struggling and turning to power generators for assistance.\n- Brian Schwartz\nRussian state gas giant Gazprom threatened to reduce gas supplies to Moldova via Ukraine, accusing Kyiv of holding onto supplies destined for its neighbor.\nIn a statement on Telegram, Gazprom said the volume of gas it was supplying to the Sudzha gas measuring station \"for transit to Moldova, through the territory of Ukraine, exceeds the physical volume transmitted at the border of Ukraine with Moldova.\"\nGazprom said its Moldovan customer, Moldovagaz, had paid for part of its supply for November on Monday but it said Ukraine had withheld 52.52 million cubic meters of gas meant for the country.\nIf the transit imbalance continued, Gazprom said, it will begin reducing gas supply to the Sudzha [gas measuring station] for transit through Ukraine from Nov. 28, saying it would reduce supplies equivalent to those that were allegedly being \"underdelivered.\"\nUkraine and Moldova have not yet responded to the claims. CNBC has contacted Ukraine's energy ministry for comment, and Moldovagaz, and is awaiting a response.\n\u2014 Holly Ellyatt\nUkraine's president held a meeting Tuesday with the head of the Ukrainian armed forces and other senior military commanders and government officials to discuss three key issues facing Ukraine's forces on the frontline.\nFirstly, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Telegram, the priority \"is to provide our army with equipment and weapons.\"\u00a0\n\"The second is the protection of energy infrastructure facilities,\" he said, while the third key issue was to \"ensure the high-quality operation of infrastructure facilities throughout the winter.\"\u00a0\nUkraine faces an uphill struggle to keep the lights on with a significant proportion of its energy infrastructure damaged or destroyed by Russian attacks. Zelenskyy said maintaining operational infrastructure would \"not be an easy walk\" but that Ukraine would persevere.\n\u2014 Holly Ellyatt\nRussian shelling hit a humanitarian aid distribution center in the town of Orihiv in southeastern Ukraine on Tuesday, killing a volunteer and wounding two women, the regional governor said.\nOleksandr Starukh, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, gave no further details of the attack on Orihiv, about 110 km (70 miles) east of the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station which has been shelled in the past few days.\nRussia and Ukraine accused each other of firing the shells that fell near reactors and damaged a radioactive waste storage building at the plant. \n\"Russian terrorists are shelling humanitarian delivery points, continuing nuclear blackmail - a pitiful tactic of military losers,\" Andriy Yermak, chief of the presidential staff, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.\n\"Well, for every such action there is a Ukrainian counteraction,\" he added.\n\u2014 Reuters\nThe Russian Orthodox Church said on Tuesday that searches conducted by Ukrainian security services at an Orthodox monastery in the capital Kyiv were an \"act of intimidation.\"\n\"Like many other cases of persecution of believers in Ukraine since 2014, this act of intimidation of believers is almost certain to go unnoticed by those who call themselves the international human rights community,\" Vladimir Legoida, a spokesperson for the church said, Reuters reported.\nUkraine said it carried out the searches at the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra complex as part of counter-intelligence measures, and that they were conducted within the law. Russia invaded Ukraine in February. \nPatriarch Kirill, the head of Russia's church, has given his support for what Moscow calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine.  \n\u2014\u00a0 Reuters\nUkrainian officials in the southern province of Zaporizhzhia say the region continues to experience Russian shelling with 58 houses and apartments destroyed over the past day.\nThe Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration said on\u00a0Telegram that Russian forces had shelled multiple settlements in the region, with Zaporizhzhia's police force receiving multiple reports on the destruction of houses and apartments and unspecified \"infrastructure objects\" as a result of shelling by Russian military personnel.\nOfficials said 78 people had been evacuated from the region during the past day, including 11 children. CNBC was unable to immediately verify the information.\n\u2014 Holly Ellyatt\nUkrainian officials in the southern province of Zaporizhzhia say the region continues to experience Russian shelling with 58 houses and apartments destroyed over the past day.\nThe Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration said on\u00a0Telegram that Russian forces had shelled multiple settlements in the region, with Zaporizhzhia's police force receiving multiple reports on the destruction of houses and apartments and unspecified \"infrastructure objects\" as a result of shelling by Russian military personnel.\nOfficials said 78 people had been evacuated from the region during the past day, including 11 children. CNBC was unable to immediately verify the information.\n\u2014 Holly Ellyatt\nUkraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk called on the residents of the recently de-occupied part of Kherson to evacuate for the winter.\n\"The government offers free evacuation to Kryvyi Rih, Mykolaiv and Odesa, with possible further movement to Kirovohrad, Khmelnytskyi or western regions of Ukraine,\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on her Telegram account.\nShe directed her call to women with children, the elderly, the sick and those with reduced mobility in particular, saying that \"given the difficult security situation in the city and infrastructure problems, you can evacuate for the winter to safer regions of the country.\"\nDisplaced people will be provided with free accommodation in shelters, humanitarian aid, food and medical support, she said.\nVereshchuk is not the first to call on people to evacuate the region, a significant part of which was liberated after a Russian withdrawal earlier in November from the western bank of the Dnipro river to the opposite bank. Russian forces gathered there have been shelling Kherson since, however.\nOther Ukrainian officials in Kherson have also warned civilians there that it's safer to evacuate the region now because of the dangers posed by Russian shelling. The region has received humanitarian aid in the form of blankets, warm clothes, food, hygiene products and medicine.\n\u2014 Holly Ellyatt\nThe World Health Organization has expressed concerns over deteriorating living conditions in Ukraine, warning that \"cold weather can kill\" and that it expects millions more could flee their homes in search of warmth and safety.\nHans Kluge, WHO's regional director for Europe, warned Monday that \"this winter will be life-threatening for millions of people in Ukraine\" amid continuing attacks on health and energy infrastructure.\n\"The devastating energy crisis, the deepening mental health emergency, constraints on humanitarian access and the risk of viral infections will make this winter a formidable test for the Ukraine health system and the Ukrainian people, but also for the world and its commitment to support Ukraine.\"\u00a0\nRepeated Russian attacks on energy facilities across Ukraine mean hundreds of hospitals and health-care facilities are no longer fully operational and are lacking fuel, water and electricity to meet basic needs, the WHO warned.\nKluge said there's a high risk that alternative and potentially toxic fuels will be used as desperate families try to stay warm this winter.\n\"Many will be forced to turn to alternative heating methods like burning charcoal or wood or using generators fueled by diesel or electric heaters. These bring health risks, including exposure to toxic substances that are harmful for children, older people and those with respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, as well as accidental burns and injuries,\" he said.\n\u2014 Holly Ellyatt\nThere are \"no immediate safety or security concerns\" at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant following heavy shelling throughout the weekend,  the International Atomic Energy Agency said.\nHowever, while key equipment remained intact, the assessment team found widespread damage across the site.\n\"This is a major cause of concern as it clearly demonstrates the sheer intensity of the attacks on one of the world's largest nuclear power plants,\" IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement after the agency conducted an investigation of the site.\nAreas of the plant damaged by the strikes included a pressurized air pipeline, the main road to reactors and condensate storage tanks, resulting in non-radioactive leakage. Operating and maintenance staff are already repairing some of the damage and plant personnel are cleaning up the site, the IAEA said.\nGrossi has repeatedly warned against fighting near the site, most recently saying that whoever was responsible for the attacks was \"playing with fire.\"\nThe renewed attacks on and around the nuclear site have intensified Grossi's calls for a protection zone, which would prevent shelling near the plant.\n\u2014 Rocio Fabbro\nOne person was killed and four others injured from Russian shelling in the Kherson region, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the Office of the President of Ukraine.\nDespite Russia's withdrawal from Kherson earlier this month, shelling has continued in the southern Ukrainian region. same t\nOver the past several months, Russia has consistently attacked civilian infrastructure, including energy systems and residential buildings. \nUkrainian officials began evacuating civilians from Kherson and a neighboring province as infrastructure damage was deemed too critical for inhabitants to safely remain during the winter.\n\u2014 Rocio Fabbro\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged NATO members to guarantee the protection of Ukraine's nuclear plants from Russian sabotage, a day after the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia plant was rocked by heavy shelling.\n\"All our nations are interested in not having any dangerous incidents at our nuclear facilities,\" Zelenskyy said in a video address to NATO's Parliamentary Assembly in Madrid.\n\"We all need guaranteed protection from Russian sabotage at nuclear facilities,\" he added.\nThe Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine was shelled on Saturday and Sunday, raising concern about the potential for a serious accident just 500 km (300 miles) from Chornobyl, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986.\n\u2014 Reuters\nThe NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Madrid called for the creation of a special international tribunal on Russia's aggression in Ukraine and recognized Russia as a terrorist state, according to a statement from the head of Ukraine's permanent delegation to the NATO assembly.\n\"All 30 NATO countries supported the proposals of our delegation,\" Yehor Chernev said in the statement. \n\"Such a tribunal will make it possible to convict not only the direct perpetrators of war crimes, but also the senior leadership of the Russian Federation.\"\nThe resolution, which also includes proposals to increase arms supplies to Ukraine, develop further steps for Ukraine's accession to NATO, and create a reparation collection mechanism, will be sent to all NATO member countries, Chernev said.\n\"The adoption of this resolution is an important political step that reflects the mood in Western parliamentary circles, and therefore influences the leadership of countries in decision-making,\" he said.\nAt the assembly, NATO Allies and the European Union also reinforced their commitment to long-term, sustained financial and military support for Ukraine.\n\u2014 Rocio Fabbro\nNATO allies Poland and Germany have agreed to deploy additional Patriot missile launchers near the Polish border with Ukraine following an offer from Berlin, Poland's defense minister said on Monday.\n\"The German Defence Minister confirmed her willingness to deploy the Patriot launcher at the border with Ukraine,\" Mariusz Blaszczak wrote on Twitter.\n\"The version of the system remains to be determined, as does how quickly they will reach us and how long they will be stationed.\"\nBerlin offered Warsaw the Patriot missile defense system to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed in Poland last week, Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht told a newspaper on Sunday.\nThe German government had already said it would offer its eastern neighbor further help in air policing with German Eurofighters after the incident, which initially raised fears that the war in Ukraine could spill across the border.\n\u2014 Reuters\nUkraine civilian death toll from war tops 6,500; NATO assembly seeks special tribunal on Russian aggression\nGot a confidential news tip?

First of all, of course, we will focus on peaceful means, but if nothing else remains, we will defend ourselves with all the means at our disposal.\nThe Russian leader said his army\u2019s \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine could be a \u201clong process\u201d, but he saw no need to mobilise additional soldiers at this point.\nOut of the 300,000 reservists who were called up to fight in Russia\u2019s partial military mobilisation in September and October, 150,000 were now deployed in Ukraine, Putin said.\nOf those, 77,000 were in combat units and the remainder performing defensive functions, he said.\nBritain has ordered \u201cseveral thousand\u201d NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year, prompting complaints from Labour that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make.\nThe Ministry of Defence announced a \u00a3230m contract with Saab, the prime contractor, to make 500 in 2023 and thousands more between 2024 and 2026, demonstrating how long it can take to replenish stocks depleted by gifts to Ukraine.\nBritain was one of the earliest weapons donors to Ukraine, announcing it would send over the first batch of NLAWs in January, a month before the Russian invasion. It has since donated about 7,000, although exact figures are not available.\nNLAWs helped Ukraine stop the Russian advance on Kyiv in February and March, with their simplicity of use praised by the Ukrainian military. The shoulder-mounted bazookas have a range of 50 to 800m and can simply be pointed at an oncoming tank.\nBen Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played \u201ca decisive role\u201d in pushing back the Russian invasion. \u201cWe are continuing to fulfil our commitment to Nato by ensuring our armed forces will receive a steady supply of these weapons over the coming years,\u201d he said.\nThe NLAWs will be assembled in Belfast by Thales, and the minister highlighted the contribution the contract would make in supporting British jobs.\nBut Labour complained about the length of time taken to sign off the deal. John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, said: \u201c287 days after Putin\u2019s invasion, ministers have finally got their act together.\u201d\nHe said the first new NLAWs \u201cstill won\u2019t be delivered until two years after the invasion\u201d, and added: \u201cIt\u2019s not clear when the MoD will sign contracts to restock other weapons and ammunition needed for the British army and to support Ukraine.\u201d\nBritain has committed \u00a32.3bn in military aid in 2023, providing a total of 10,000 anti-tank weapons including Javelin and Brimstone missiles, NLAWs, M270 rocket artillery, 200 armoured vehicles, 28 M109 artillery guns plus almost 100,000 rounds, and 3m bullets, plus more than 25,000 sets of winter clothing.\nVladimir Putin has said there is no need for an additional call-up of Russian reservists to fight in Ukraine at the moment, Reuters reported.\nPutin said that of the more than 300,000 Russian reservists who were drafted in what Moscow called a \u201cpartial mobilisation\u201d in September and October, 150,000 were deployed in the zone of what Moscow calls its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d in Ukraine.\nOf those, 77,000 were in combat units and the remainder were performing defensive functions, he said.\nThe US has been very clear with Ukraine about accountability over weapons systems and its concerns over escalation of the war with Russia, the White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday.\n\u201cWe have been consistent on our concerns over escalation. We have not encouraged them to do that,\u201d Kirby said, after apparent Ukrainian drone strikes on two airbases deep inside Russia.\nIn his office in Kyiv city hall, the mayor, Vitali Klitschko, is planning for the worst and hoping for the best, Peter Beaumont writes.\nThe previous day, in the middle of the sixth mass Russian missile strike against Ukrainian cities that had sent Kyiv\u2019s resident to the bomb shelters and metro stations, no rockets had made it through to hit the capital.\nOn the mayor\u2019s desk is a newspaper he has had produced and distributed around the city in recent days. Bearing his name, and the headline \u201cWe will overcome and win\u201d, it lists all the emergency services in Kyiv that will be available in case of what should be unthinkable but isn\u2019t: the failure of all power and services to a city of 3 million in the depths of Ukraine\u2019s winter.\nAcross three densely printed pages are details of supermarkets with generators that will work in that emergency, the post offices and banks, and arrangements for public transit.\nIt lists the 45 underground metro stations that will remain open as shelters and provide phone charging and internet, as well as tips for surviving a prolonged blackout.\n\u201cIt\u2019s for the worst-case scenario,\u201d says Klitschko, a former world champion boxer turned politician, picking up the paper.\nWe need to tell people what they need to do if the situation becomes critical and they don\u2019t have internet and connection to media.\nLife in the city can often seem largely normal, outside of the massive airstrikes that have been taking place, often weekly, since 20 October. Restaurants are busy and the streets are jammed with traffic at close to prewar levels, but with the first snow on the ground and the temperature hitting -8C this week, life in the capital is also overshadowed by the risk of a humanitarian crisis.\n\u201cThanks to our military, they knocked out all the missiles fired at Kyiv yesterday,\u201d says Klitschko.\nBut it was only two weeks ago we came close to a total blackout. Then the temperature was above freezing, but imagine the same situation if it happened now when it is close to -10 outside and with no electricity water, or heating. The consequences would be disastrous.\nRead the full story here:\nAt least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine, according to a report by the UN\u2019s human rights office.\nThe Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) documented summary executions and attacks in dozens of towns across three regions, and warned the actual number of victims in the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions was likely to be much higher.\nThe report covered the beginning of Moscow\u2019s invasion on 24 February until early April, and gathered evidence from 102 towns and villages in Ukraine.\nIt said:\nThe acts in question were committed by Russian armed forces in control of these areas and led to the deaths of 441 civilians (341 men, 72 women, 20 boys and 8 girls).\nMany of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report said. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in what it calls a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d.\nIn a statement, the UN\u2019s high commissioner for human rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, said:\nThere are strong indications that the summary executions documented in the report constitute the war crime of wilful killing.\nOverall in the war through 4 December, the OHCHR said it had counted 6,702 civilian deaths, and that its monitoring includes violations by all parties.","39":"Credit Cards\nLoans\nBanking\nMortgages\nInsurance\nCredit Monitoring\nPersonal Finance\nSmall Business\nTaxes\nHelp for Low Credit Scores\nInvesting\nSELECT\nAll Credit Cards\nFind the Credit Card for You\nBest Credit Cards\nBest Rewards Credit Cards\nBest Travel Credit Cards\nBest 0% APR Credit Cards\nBest Balance Transfer Credit Cards\nBest Cash Back Credit Cards\nBest Credit Card Welcome Bonuses\nBest Credit Cards to Build Credit\nSELECT\nAll Loans\nFind the Best Personal Loan for You\nBest Personal Loans\nBest Debt Consolidation Loans\nBest Loans to Refinance Credit Card Debt\nBest Loans with Fast Funding\nBest Small Personal Loans\nBest Large Personal Loans\nBest Personal Loans to Apply Online\nBest Student Loan Refinance\nSELECT\nAll Banking\nFind the Savings Account for You\nBest High Yield Savings Accounts\nBest Big Bank Savings Accounts\nBest Big Bank Checking Accounts\nBest No Fee Checking Accounts\nNo Overdraft Fee Checking Accounts\nBest Checking Account Bonuses\nBest Money Market Accounts\nBest CDs\nBest Credit Unions\nSELECT\nAll Mortgages\nBest Mortgages\nBest Mortgages for Small Down Payment\nBest Mortgages for No Down Payment\nBest Mortgages with No Origination Fee\nBest Mortgages for Average Credit Score\nAdjustable Rate Mortgages\nAffording a Mortgage\nSELECT\nAll Insurance\nBest Life Insurance\nBest Homeowners Insurance\nBest Renters Insurance\nBest Car Insurance\nTravel Insurance\nSELECT\nAll Credit Monitoring\nBest Credit Monitoring Services\nBest Identity Theft Protection\nHow to Boost Your Credit Score\nCredit Repair Services\nSELECT\nAll Personal Finance\nBest Budgeting Apps\nBest Expense Tracker Apps\nBest Money Transfer Apps\nBest Resale Apps and Sites\nBuy Now Pay Later (BNPL) Apps\nBest Debt Relief\nSELECT\nAll Small Business\nBest Small Business Savings Accounts\nBest Small Business Checking Accounts\nBest Credit Cards for Small Business\nBest Small Business Loans\nBest Tax Software for Small Business\nSELECT\nAll Taxes\nBest Tax Software\nBest Tax Software for Small Businesses\nTax Refunds\nSELECT\nAll Help for Low Credit Scores\nBest Credit Cards for Bad Credit\nBest Personal Loans for Bad Credit\nBest Debt Consolidation Loans for Bad Credit\nPersonal Loans if You Don't Have Credit\nBest Credit Cards for Building Credit\nPersonal Loans for 580 Credit Score or Lower\nPersonal Loans for 670 Credit Score or Lower\nBest Mortgages for Bad Credit\nBest Hardship Loans\nHow to Boost Your Credit Score\nSELECT\nAll Investing\nBest IRA Accounts\nBest Roth IRA Accounts\nBest Investing Apps\nBest Free Stock Trading Platforms\nBest Robo-Advisors\nIndex Funds\nMutual Funds\nETFs\nBonds\n\nThis is CNBC's live blog tracking developments on the war in Ukraine. See below for the latest updates.\u00a0\nRussia warned the U.S. that if it sends Patriot missile systems to Ukraine it will consider the move a provocation that could lead to \"unpredictable consequences.\"\nThe Biden administration is finalizing plans to send a Patriot missile system to Ukraine, three defense officials told NBC News earlier this week. The surface-to-air defense system would help Ukraine repel Russian aerial attacks.\nThe Russian embassy in Washington said in a statement on Telegram Wednesday that sending the Patriot missile system would be considered \"provocative.\"\nIn his nightly address Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian forces were destroying \"everything in front of them.\" He added that \"city after city\" in Donbas in eastern Ukraine was being destroyed.\n\"There is no calm on the front line. There is nothing easy and simple. Every day and every meter is fought for extremely hard,\" Zelenskyy said in a nightly address on his Telegram channel.\nThe Pentagon will expand military combat training for Ukrainian forces, using the slower winter months to instruct larger units in more complex battle skills, U.S. officials said.\nThe U.S. has already trained about 3,100 Ukrainian troops on how to use and maintain certain weapons and other equipment, including howitzers, armored vehicles and the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS. But senior military leaders for months have discussed expanding that training, touting the need to improve the ability of Ukraine's company- and battalion-sized units to move and coordinate attacks across the battlefield.\nA battalion can include as many as 800 troops; a company is much smaller, with a couple hundred forces.\nAccording to officials, the training will take place at the Grafenwoehr training area in Germany. And the aim is to use the winter months to hone the skills of the Ukrainian forces so they will be better prepared to counter any spike in Russian attacks or efforts to expand Russia's territorial gains.\n\u2014 Associated Press\nThe European Union said it approved a new package of sanctions aimed at ramping up pressure on Russia for its war in Ukraine.\nThe package, whose details have not been revealed, was approved after days of deliberations during a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's ambassadors.\nThe Czech Republic, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, said the package will be confirmed by written procedure on Friday. Details will then be published in the bloc's legal records.\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive branch, last week proposed travel bans and asset freezes on almost 200 more Russian officials and military officers as part of the new round of measures.\nThe targets of the latest recommended sanctions included government ministers, lawmakers, regional governors and political parties.\n\u2014 Associated Press\nFour ships carrying wheat and vegetable oil have left ports in Ukraine, the organization managing agricultural exports from the country said. \nThe ships are destined for India and Turkey.\nThe\u00a0Black Sea Grain Initiative, a deal brokered in July among Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the United Nations, saw three key Ukrainian ports reopen after a Russian naval blockade stopped exports for months. More than 13.9 million tons of grain and other products have left Ukraine since the agreement took effect.\nThe deal among the signatories is set to expire in about three months.\n\u2014 Amanda Macias\nUnited Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths said it was unlikely the Black Sea grain deal would be expanded in the near term to include more Ukrainian ports or reduce inspection times.\nKyiv has called for an expansion of the deal with Moscow which was mediated by the United Nations and Turkey and allows Ukraine, a major global grain exporter, to ship food products from three of its Black Sea ports despite Russia's invasion.\n\"I don't see that happening in the next, near term,\" the U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator told Reuters in an interview in the Ukrainian capital.\n\"I think it would be great if it could be expanded, the more grain that gets out into the world, the better clearly from our point of view, from the world's point of view. But I don't think that's immediately likely.\"\n\u2014 Reuters\nUkrainians take shelter from Russian attacks in Bakhmut, Ukraine.\n\u2014 Diego Herrera Carcedo | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\nThe U.S. Treasury Department announced it has sanctioned a bank owned by a Russian billionaire, along with 17 subsidiaries of Russia's second-largest bank VTB. \nThe department made the move in tandem with designations the State Department issued against a prominent Russian oligarch, his associates and over 40 others linked to the Russian government. The efforts aim to limit Russian President Vladimir Putin's ability to fund Moscow's war with Ukraine.\nAccess to all properties and interests on U.S. soil owned by any of the sanctioned has been blocked.\n\u2014 Chelsey Cox\nUkrainian military experts show downed drones that Russia allegedly uses for striking critical infrastructure and other targets in Ukraine during a press conference in Kyiv.\nUkraine said on Wednesday it had shot down more than a dozen drones in Moscow's latest assault on Kyiv.\n\u2014 Getty Images\nU.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink cheered the release of a U.S. citizen from Russian detention following another prisoner swap between Moscow and Kyiv.\n\"Great to see a U.S. citizen freed from Russia-controlled territory,\" Brink wrote on Twitter.\n\"Thanks to\u00a0Andriy Yermak\u00a0and our Ukrainian partners for their continued efforts to secure the freedom of U.S. citizens held by Russia's forces,\" she continued.\nSixty-four Ukrainian soldiers, who were captured in the Russian-held areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, and the U.S. citizen Suedi Murekezi were included in the exchange, Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, said on Telegram on Wednesday.\n\u2014 Amanda Macias\nRussia is digging in for a long war in Ukraine and still wants to conquer the entire country, a senior Ukrainian military official said.\nBrigadier General Oleksiy Gromov told a military briefing that although he did not expect Moscow to launch an attack from Belarus, Russian was training new troops on its neighbor's soil and had moved military aircraft there.\nDeputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar, at the same briefing, warned against allowing complacency to set in after recent Russian military setbacks.\nUkrainian officials have portrayed the Kremlin as desperate to reverse recent military setbacks - which included a retreat from the southern city of Kherson after months of occupation - and secure victories to justify the war to the Russian public.\nThe Kremlin has never fully defined the goals of its Feb. 24 invasion, which it said was partly intended to protect Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine.\n\u2014 Reuters\nThe organization in charge of exporting Ukrainian crops said 92 ships are waiting to be loaded with cargo. \nSixty-eight loaded vessels are also awaiting inspection in Turkish territorial waters, the U.N.-led Joint Coordination Center said. \nThe\u00a0Black Sea Grain Initiative, a deal brokered in July among Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and the United Nations, led to the reopening of three key Ukrainian ports after a Russian naval blockade stopped exports for months.\nSince the agreement went into effect, more than 550 ships carrying 13.9 million metric tons of grain and other agricultural products have departed for destinations around the globe.\nKyiv has contended Moscow has held up inspections and delayed ship departures.\n\u2014 Amanda Macias\nA senior U.N. official voiced optimism that there would be a breakthrough in negotiations to ease exports of Russian fertilizers to avoid food shortages next year.\nRussia has complained its concerns about fertilizer exports had not been addressed when a deal for extending a Black Sea grain export agreement was agreed in November.\nLow Russian fertilizer exports remained a \"major concern\" to avoid food shortages next year, said the Secretary-General of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, Rebeca Grynspan, a key U.N. negotiator.\n\"I am cautiously optimistic that we can have important progress soon,\" she told reporters in Geneva. \"We will spare no effort in trying to make this happen as we really think it is essential for avoiding a food security crisis in the world.\"\nShe declined to give further details.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u00a0has indicated that he would only back the reopening of Russian ammonia exports, used to make fertilizer, in exchange for a prisoner swap and negotiations\u00a0have since focused on this.\n\u2014 Reuters\nUkrainian first lady Olena Zelenska thanked France for its \"solidarity\" with the Ukrainian people as Russia's war enters its eleventh month.\nZelenska went to France on Sunday. She led a Ukrainian delegation that included Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. \nDuring her visit, Zelenska met with Ukrainian families who have taken temporary resident status in France.\n\u2014 Amanda Macias\nDoctors shed their scrubs for street clothes. And one by one,\u00a0the staff of the largest hospital\u00a0in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine slipped away as Russian forces seized control of the city's center.\nMonths later, around 30 staff members from Mariupol's Hospital No. 2 have reassembled in Kyiv. Along with 30 specialists from a cardiac hospital in Kramatorsk, a Donetsk city that remains under Ukraine's control, they are opening a pared-down version of a public hospital to help displaced Ukrainians in need of care.\nMuch of Ukraine's medical infrastructure is going to have to be rebuilt from scratch.\u00a0The World Health Organization has documented 715 attacks\u00a0on health care in Ukraine during the war.\nA study released last week\u00a0by the Ukrainian Health Care Center found nearly 80% of the medical facilities in Mariupol alone were\u00a0damaged or destroyed, or 82 out of the 106 locations the center analyzed with a combination of satellite imagery and witness testimony.\n\u2014 Associated Press\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said a decision has yet to be taken on repairs to the Nord Stream gas pipelines, which sustained damage in September.\n\"It has not yet come down to repairs, no decisions have been made on this matter,\" he said, according to Russian state news agency Tass.\nThe twin undersea Nord Stream pipelines transport critical natural gas resources from Russia to Germany. Russian state gas company Gazprom intermittently suspended the gas flows to Germany from late August, citing maintenance issues, though the move was widely believed to be in response to EU sanctions on Russia. \nAfter explosions hit the pipelines in late September \u2014 a clandestine act for which no one has taken responsibility \u2014 Gazprom said it was closing Nord Stream indefinitely. Gas prices in Europe, which were already multiples higher than at the same time one year prior, soared further as a result. \nMoscow previously accused the British navy of blowing up the infrastructure in September, which London has rejected. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg labeled damage to the pipelines as sabotage.\n\u2014 Ruxandra Iordache\nThe United Nations high commissioner for human rights warned of dramatically worse conditions to come in Ukraine if Russia continues attacking the country's infrastructure.\n\"Additional strikes could lead to a further serious deterioration in the humanitarian situation and spark more displacement,\" Volker Turk, the high commissioner, said to the organization's human rights council after a visit to Ukraine. Russia's attacks on key energy facilities and other vital civilian infrastructure were putting millions of people through \"extreme hardship,\" he said.\nHuge swathes of Ukraine are facing regular and often prolonged blackouts as authorities race to repair them after each attack. Geopolitical analysts say the aim of the Russian strikes is to make large parts of the country unlivable as the cold winter sets in, threatening starvation and death. \nRights groups say that deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure is a war crime. The Kremlin has argued that its strikes are in response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian facilities like its Crimean bridge, which was damaged in an explosion on Oct. 8. Russia has been attacking Ukraine since Feb. 24. \n\u2014 Natasha Turak\nMembers of the Ukrainian military relax in a makeshift sauna built by members of the brigade in an underground bunker while on a day off from being stationed in Bakhmut at a position on the outskirts of Donetsk, Ukraine.\n\u2014 Chris McGrath | Getty Images\nThe deputy chief of Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces has ruled out the possibility of a ceasefire while Russian invaders remain on Ukrainian soil. \nMoscow on Dec. 14 similarly said that a\u00a0potential suspension of hostilities for Christmas\u00a0was not on the cards, after 10 months of war in Ukraine.\n\"I believe that there will be a complete ceasefire from our side only when not a single occupier remains on our land,\" Ukrainian state news agency Ukrinform quoted Brigadier General Oleksiy Gromov as saying today, according to a Google translation. His comment came in response to a question over a prospective suspension of hostilities for New Year celebrations.\n\u2014 Ruxandra Iordache\nRussian shelling in Ukraine's south-eastern city of Kherson killed two people, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president's office, wrote on Telegram.\nThe individuals were killed in the city's center, about 100 meters away from the regional administration building, Tymoshenko said. Kherson was recaptured by Ukrainian forces and liberated from its Russian occupiers in early November, but since then has faced near-constant shelling by Russia forces, many of whom remain on the other side of the Dnipro River.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin in late September declared Kherson and three other Ukrainian regions as annexed by Russia, a move that is illegal under international law, and has vowed to keep them as Russian territory.\n\u2014 Natasha Turak\nEU member states failed to reach consensus on a new sanctions package for Russia, which would be the bloc's ninth since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in late February.\nProgress on the sanctions stalled due to disagreement over whether the EU should ease the process of Russian fertilizers being transported through European ports. Poland and the Baltic states objected, saying a relaxation of restrictions could be used by Russian oligarchs who own fertilizer businesses to evade sanctions, according to EU officials cited by Reuters.\nThose in favor of the easing say that the current restrictions threaten food security, particularly in developing nations. Russia is the world's top exporter of fertilizer. Some states want the UN's World Food Programme to become involved in authorizing fertilizer exports to parts of the world that rely on them.\n\u2014 Natasha Turak\nRussia has warned the U.S. that if it sends Patriot missile systems to Ukraine it will consider the move a provocation that could lead to \"unpredictable consequences.\"\nThe Biden administration is finalizing plans to send a Patriot missile system to Ukraine, three Defense officials told NBC News earlier this week. The surface-to-air defense system would help Ukraine repel Russian aerial attacks and President Zelenskyy has long called for such weaponry to help Ukraine defend itself against repeated missile attacks.\nThe Russian embassy in Washington warned in a statement on Telegram Wednesday that sending the Patriot missile system would be considered \"provocative.\"\"An information campaign has been launched in the United States\u00a0on a possible future shipment of modern air defense systems to Kiev.\u00a0It is said that President Biden may soon take such a decision.\" the statement from the Russian embassy noted.\"If this is confirmed,\u00a0we will witness yet\u00a0another provocative step by the administration, which can lead to unpredictable consequences.\"\nThe embassy claimed that, even without delivery of the Patriot systems, \"the United States is increasingly drawn into the conflict in the post-Soviet republic, saying that the \"weapons flow\" to Ukraine was increasing and that the U.S. was helping Ukraine in terms of intelligence and military training.\nThe Kremlin said Wednesday that it would consider Patriot missile defense systems as a legitimate target for Russian strikes if they are sent to Ukraine.\n\u2014 Holly Ellyatt\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian forces are destroying \"everything in front of them.\"\n\"There is no calm on the front line. There is nothing easy and simple. Every day and every meter is fought for extremely hard,\" Zelenskyy said in a nightly address on his Telegram channel.\n\"Russia is destroying city after city in Donbas - like Mariupol, like Volnovakha, like Bakhmut,\" he added..\nZelenskyy also thanked Ukrainian forces for \"repelling another attack by Iranian drones this morning.\"\n\u2014 Amanda Macias\nMoscow said no \"Christmas ceasefire\" was on the cards after nearly 10 months of war in Ukraine, where the first major drone attack on the capital Kyiv in weeks damaged two buildings but was largely repelled by air defenses.\nThe two sides are not currently engaged in talks to end the conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions more and turned cities to rubble since Russia invaded its neighbour on Feb. 24.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this week Russia should start withdrawing from his country by Christmas as a step to end Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two. Moscow rejected the proposal outright, saying Ukraine must accept the loss of territory to Russia before any progress can be made.\n\u2014 Reuters\nThe U.N. warned that nearly 7 million children in Ukraine are don't have regular access to electricity, heat or water, raising their risks as temperatures drop. \n\"Millions of children are facing a bleak winter huddled in the cold and the dark, with little idea of how or when respite may arrive,\" UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell said in a statement.\nIn addition to the freezing temperatures, the lack of adequate electricity interrupts their education with schools damaged or destroyed and so many children relying on remote learning, UNICEF said. \n\"Beyond the immediate threats the freezing conditions bring, children are also deprived of the ability to learn or stay connected with friends and family, putting both their physical and their mental health at desperate risk,\" she added.\nIn October, Russian forces intensified attacks on energy infrastructure and were successful in destroying nearly half of Ukraine's power production.\n\u2014 Amanda Macias\nU.S. and Russia make another prisoner swap; Moscow says no 'Christmas ceasefire'\nGot a confidential news tip?

Not the full-scale war that has bombed civilians across Ukraine and left more than 13 million either as refugees abroad or displaced inside their own country. \nHis declared goal on 24 February 2022 was to \"demilitarise and denazify\" Ukraine and not occupy it by force, days after backing independence for eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014. \nHe vowed to protect people from eight years of Ukrainian bullying and genocide - a Russian propaganda claim with no foundation in reality. He spoke of preventing Nato from gaining a foothold in Ukraine, then added another objective of ensuring Ukraine's neutral status.\nPresident Putin never said it out loud, but high on the agenda was toppling the government of Ukraine's elected president. \"The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two,\" said Volodymyr Zelensky. Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound, according to his adviser. \nRussian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide never added up, but Russian state-run news agency Ria Novosti explained that \"denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation\" - in effect, erasing the modern state of Ukraine.\nFor years, the Russian president has denied Ukraine its own statehood, writing in a lengthy 2021 essay that \"Russians and Ukrainians were one people\" dating back to the late 9th Century.\nA month into the invasion and his campaign goals were dramatically scaled back after a retreat from Kyiv and Chernihiv. The main goal became the \"liberation of Donbas\" - broadly referring to Ukraine's two industrial regions in the east of Luhansk and Donetsk.\nForced into further retreats from Kharkiv in the north-east and Kherson in the south, that aim remains unchanged, but it has shown little success in achieving it.\nThose reverses on the battlefield rushed Russia's leader into annexing four Ukrainian provinces last September, without having full control of any of them: neither Luhansk or Donetsk in the east, nor Kherson or Zaporizhzhia to the south. \nTo bolster his depleted forces President Putin announced Russia's first mobilisation since World War Two, although it was partial and limited to some 300,000 reservists. \nA war of attrition is now taking place along an active front line of 850km (530 miles) and Russian victories are small and rare. What was meant to be a quick operation is now a protracted war that Western leaders are determined Ukraine should win. Any realistic prospect of neutrality for Ukraine is long gone.\nPresident Putin warned in December that the war \"could be a lengthy process\", but then added later that Russia's goal was \"not to spin the flywheel of military conflict\", but to end it. There is little hope of that on the horizon.\nA year into the war, he talks of Russia fighting to defend its \"historical frontiers\" and \"rebuilding peaceful life in Donbas and Novorossiya\", spelling out that Ukraine's southern territories are part of his project, just as much as the east.\nThe biggest success President Putin can lay claim to is establishing a land bridge from Russia's border to Crimea, annexed illegally in 2014, so it is no longer reliant on its bridge over the Kerch Strait. \nHe has spoken of the capture of this territory, which includes the cities of Mariupol and Melitopol, as a \"significant result for Russia\". The Sea of Azov, inside the Kerch Strait, \"has become Russia's internal sea\", he declared, pointing out that even Russian Tsar Peter the Great did not manage that. \nBeyond seizing a territorial corridor to Crimea, Russia's bloody, unprovoked war has been a disaster for itself and the country it was unleashed on. So far, it has achieved little more than exposing the brutality and inadequacy of the Russian military.\nWhile cities such as Mariupol were flattened, details of war crimes have emerged against civilians in Bucha, near Kyiv, and have led to an independent report that accused Russia itself of state-orchestrated incitement to genocide.\nBut it is the military failures that have shown Russia at its weakest:\nRussia's warnings to the West against arming Ukraine have gone unheeded, with Western assurances of support \"for as long as it takes\" and pledges that Nato will never be divided. \nSuperior US Himars missiles helped turn the course of the war and German Leopard 2 tanks are promised, even if Western fighter jets are not. A succession of Western leaders, including President Joe Biden, have made the complex journey to Kyiv.\nBut this war is not over. The fight for Donbas continues. Russia has captured the town of Soledar this year and has hopes of seizing the eastern city of Bakhmut on the road to key cities to the west, and of recapturing territory it lost last autumn.\nPutin watchers believe he will seek to extend control of the four regions that he has declared to be part of Russia, not just in Donbas, but towards the key city of Zaporizhzhia.\nShould he need to, President Putin could extend mobilisation and drag out the war. Russia is a nuclear power and he has indicated he would be prepared, if necessary, to use nuclear weapons to protect Russia and cling on to occupied Ukrainian land. \"We will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff,\" he warned.\nKyiv believes Russia is also seeking to depose the pro-European government in Moldova, where Russian troops are based in the breakaway region of Transnistria bordering Ukraine.\nNeither Russia nor Ukraine give details of their own losses, so reliable numbers are extremely difficult. But Russians losses have been especially heavy in recent weeks, with several hundred deaths every day on the battlefields of the east.\nBBC Russian has identified more than 15,000 Russian soldiers killed in the first year of war and suggests the most conservative estimate would be at least double that, with more than 100,000 others wounded or missing.\nUK defence intelligence believes Russian casualties increased significantly after partial mobilisation, reaching 175-200,000 in total, of whom 40-60,000 were killed.\nUkraine revealed at the end of 2022 that 10-13,000 of its soldiers had been killed since the start of the war. That figure cannot be confirmed, but it followed a US estimate of some 100,000 Ukrainians killed or wounded by November. Before Western artillery arrived in the east last summer, Kyiv officials said 100 to 200 troops were dying every day.\nThe UN human rights commissioner says at least 8,006 civilians have died and 13,287 have been wounded in 12 months of war, but the true number is likely to be substantially higher.\nPresident Putin, 70, has sought to distance himself from military failures, but his authority, at least outside Russia, has been shredded and he makes few trips beyond its borders.\nAt home, Russia's economy on the surface appears to have weathered a series of Western sanctions for now, although its budget deficit has soared and oil and gas revenue has fallen dramatically.\nAny attempt to gauge his popularity is fraught with difficulty.\nDissent in Russia is highly risky, with jail sentences handed out for anyone spreading \"fake news\" about the Russian military. Those opposing Russia's leadership have either fled or, as with main opposition figure Alexei Navalny, been thrown into prison.\nThe seeds of this war were sown in 2013, when Moscow persuaded Ukraine's pro-Russian leader to scrap a planned pact with the European Union, prompting protests that ultimately brought him down and led to Russia seizing Crimea and staging a land-grab in the east.\nFour months into Russia's 2022 invasion, the EU granted Ukraine candidate status and Kyiv is pushing to be accepted as soon as it can.\nRussia's long-time leader was also desperate to prevent Ukraine from entering Nato's orbit, but his attempt to blame the Western defensive alliance for the war is false.\nNot only did Ukraine reportedly agree before the war a provisional deal with Russia to stay out of Nato but, in March, President Zelensky offered to maintain Ukraine as a non-aligned, non-nuclear state:  \"It's a truth and it must be recognised.\"\nNo end is currently in sight. \nUkraine's position is that Russian troops must pull back beyond Ukraine's internationally recognised borders for there to be peace. It is backed by two UN resolutions, passed days after the invasion and hours before the first anniversary of the war.\nBy annexing four regions Russia does not even fully control, Vladimir Putin has made it very hard for himself to give them up.\nThere is little prospect for now of a ceasefire or peace talks. Turkey had some success last summer with the UN in mediating a deal on resuming grain exports through the Black Sea but has had no success since. China is looking for a role in securing a political settlement, but its position is probably too close to Russia to be considered an honest broker.\nNato member states have increasingly sent Ukraine air defence systems to protect its cities, as well as missile systems, artillery and drones that helped turn the tide against Russia's invasion.\nBut it is not to blame for the war and has no troops on the ground. Nato's expansion comes as a response to the Russian threat - Sweden and Finland only applied to join because of the invasion. \nBlaming Nato's expansion eastwards is a Russian narrative that has gained some ground in Europe. Before the war, President Putin demanded Nato turn the clock back to 1997 and remove its forces and military infrastructure from Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics.\nIn his eyes, the West promised back in 1990 that Nato would expand \"not an inch to the east\", yet did so anyway. That was before the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, so the promise made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev referred merely to East Germany in the context of a reunified Germany.\nMr Gorbachev said later that \"the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed\" at the time.\nNato maintains it never intended to deploy combat troops on its eastern flank, until Russia annexed Crimea illegally in 2014.\nWhat are your questions about the war in Ukraine?

The IDF said Saturday it would allow safe movement on specified streets for residents to move from the northern city of Beit Hanoun to Khan Yunis in the south \u2014 a roughly 20-mile distance of rubble-strewn streets.\nSouthern Gaza is struggling to accommodate the influx of people. Shelters are overloaded and the area is experiencing shortages of food, water and fuel. \nConricus said Israel has \u201copened taps\u201d on its side to allow water to enter southern Gaza, but said he \"doesn't have visibility on exactly how much is actually flowing where it should.\"\n\n\nFrom CNN's Jennifer Hauser\nShelters in southern Gaza are overloaded, with shortages of crucial supplies, as tens of thousands of people flee from Israeli airstrikes on the north of the coastal enclave, a UN official said Sunday. \nSouthern Gaza is also experiencing shortages of food, water and fuel, she said. \n\"There\u2019s some food in distribution sites, but we can't get to them because of the bombardment,\" Hastings said. \nThe fuel scarcity has widespread ramifications for the area. \n\"No fuel means no desalination,\" Hastings said. \"Gaza is heavily reliant on desalination. No fuel also means no health care because you need electricity to run hospitals.\"\nOn Sunday,\u00a0Israel's ambassador to the United Nations told CNN water has been turned back on in southern Gaza, but he didn't say if electricity was on for desalination.\nFrom CNN's Sehar Ahmed\nIsrael \"has no interest\" in occupying Gaza but will do \"whatever is needed\" to eliminate Hamas, the country's ambassador to the United Nations said Sunday. \nHis remarks come after US President Joe Biden warned Israel against occupying the coastal enclave as it signals it is preparing for a ground invasion amid a spiraling humanitarian crisis.\nIn an interview with CBS\u2019 \u201c60 Minutes\u201d that aired Sunday, Biden said it would be a \u201cbig mistake\u201d for Israel to occupy Gaza.His comments amount to one of the\u00a0few times the US president\u00a0has called on Israel to use restraint in responding to the Hamas attacks that left 1,400 dead. \nMichael Herzog, the Israeli ambassador to the US, told CNN on Sunday that Israel does not intend to occupy Gaza after the conflict ends.\n\u201cWe have no desire to occupy or reoccupy Gaza. We have no desire to rule over the lives of more than 2 million Palestinians,\u201d Herzog said.\nBiden meanwhile, has called for the protection of civilians as the US has been working to alleviate shortages of food, water and gas.\nErdan said water has been turned back on in southern Gaza, but he didn't say if electricity was on for desalination.\nFrom CNN\u2019s Mihir Melwani and Xiaofei Xu\n\n\nLarge-scale demonstrations in support of Palestinians took place around Europe\u00a0this weekend as conditions in\u00a0Gaza\u00a0deteriorated with tens of thousands of residents attempting to flee\u00a0Israeli airstrikes.\nAs the conflict reaches unprecedented heights, protests in support of both Israelis and Palestinians have been seen around the world \u2014 some resulting in violent clashes.\nHere's a roundup:\nFrom CNN\u2019s Beijing bureau and Larry Register\nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday reiterated Beijing\u2019s support for an independent Palestinian state as a way out of the conflict in Israel and Gaza.\nIn a phone call with his Iranian counterpart, Wang presented China as a peace broker, saying Beijing would \u201cstand on the side of peace and justice and to support the Palestinian people in their just cause of safeguarding their national rights.\u201d\n\"This historical injustice should be brought to an end as soon as possible,\" he said.\nIn a separate call with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Wang called for a ceasefire, the opening of humanitarian aid routes to Gaza and the resumption of dialogue between Israel and Palestinian authorities.\nWithout mentioning Israel, he said, \u201cthe right to self-defence should be exercised in compliance with international humanitarian law and not at the expense of innocent civilian casualties,\u201d according to a Chinese Foreign Ministry readout.\nSome context: China has long supported a \"two-state solution\" to establish an independent Palestinian state. Both Israel and the United States have expressed strong dissatisfaction to China for not strongly condemning Hamas\u2019 deadly and brutal attacks against Israelis on October 7, and for not showing support to Israel following the massacre.\nFrom CNN\u2019s Eyad Kourdi and Abby Baggini\n\n\nHospitals in Gaza are under constant bombardment and facing imminent shutdown due to a lack of fuel, a Palestinian humanitarian official said Sunday. \nSpeaking to CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett from Ramallah in the West Bank, Palestinian Red Crescent Director General Marwan Jilani said food, water, medicine, and fuel are in critically short supply. \nHe said hospitals in the coastal enclave have only enough fuel for Monday, and perhaps the day after. They cannot operate without fuel, he said.\nJilani called for a ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza from the Rafah crossing. He said Israel and Egypt were ready to facilitate aid delivery, contingent upon a cessation of hostilities.\u00a0\nSome context: The Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, the only remaining outlet for aid, has been closed for much of the past week, with tons of vital humanitarian supplies for people in Gaza piling up on the Egyptian side of the border.\nUS\u00a0Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that \"Rafah\u00a0will be open\" after meeting with Egyptian President\u00a0Abdel Fattah El-Sisi.\nFrom CNN's Tara Subramaniam\nUS National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Sunday warned of the risk of a wider regional conflict in the Middle East as Israel pounds Gaza with airstrikes in response to Hamas' unprecedented surprise attacks.\nThe Pentagon has ordered a second carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean Sea and is sending Air Force fighter jets to the region as\u00a0Israel prepares to expand its Gaza operations, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Saturday.\nThe US warships are not intended to join the\u00a0fighting in Gaza\u00a0or take part in Israel\u2019s operations, but the presence of two of the Navy\u2019s most powerful vessels is designed to send a message of deterrence to Iran and Iranian proxies in the region, such as Hezbollah in Lebanon.\nSome more context: If Hezbollah joins the conflict, it could provide the next flashpoint that would entangle bigger regional powers such as Iran and Saudi Arabia.\nIsrael has long accused Iran of engaging in a form of\u00a0proxy war\u00a0by backing groups \u2014 including Hamas \u2014 that have launched attacks on its shores. Iran has denied any involvement in the October 7 attacks.\nUS President Joe Biden on Sunday said there\u2019s \"no clear evidence\" of Iran being behind the attacks.\u00a0\nPlease enable JavaScript for a better experience.","42":"Live\nIsrael-Hamas war\nLive\nGOP debate highlights\nBy Tara Subramaniam, Adam Renton, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Christian Edwards, Dakin Andone, Mike Hayes, Elise Hammond, Maureen Chowdhury, Zoe Sottile, Amir Vera and Meg Wagner, CNN\nOur live coverage of the\u00a0conflict in Israel and Gaza has moved here.\nFrom CNN's Oren Liebermann\nThe head of US Central Command arrived in Israel Monday to meet with the chief of staff of the country\u2019s military, according to a statement from US Central Command.\u00a0\nGen.

His visit comes as US Secretary of State Antony Blinken is conducting shuttle diplomacy in the region, including a nearly eight-hour long meeting with Israel\u2019s war cabinet. \nDiplomatic efforts to address the crisis are intensifying, with US President Joe Biden also scheduled to visit Israel Wednesday. \nFrom CNN's Sam Fossum\n\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Michael McCaul told CNN Monday that his committee is drafting legislation \u201cin the event it\u2019s necessary\u201d to authorize US military force if the current conflict between Israel and Hamas broadens into a wider proxy war with Iran.\u00a0\nThe revelation that his committee is crafting draft legislation \u2014 known as an Authorization of Use for Military Force \u2014 comes as President Joe Biden prepares to travel to the region later this week and is the latest indication that the US government is deeply concerned over how the current crisis could broaden in a way that might require a US military response.\u00a0\nThe US military ordered a second carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean as well as Air Force fighter jets to the region as part of US efforts to deter Iran and its proxies from expanding the conflict.\u00a0\nMcCaul was careful not to say whether the White House had specifically asked for such an authorization, telling reporters:\u00a0\"I don't want to confirm that. It's just that there is concern that \u2014 we, I'm currently, we're currently drafting one in the event it's necessary.\"\nWhen asked by CNN what this potential authorization might entail, McCaul said: \u201cI'd prefer not to put Iran as a nation state in there. It would be more Iran proxies, you know, like Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran-backed Shi\u2019ia militias, but if Iran gets directly involved, then we would have to put them on the list.\"\nIn an interview later with CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins, McCaul said he would want any potential authorization to have the full support of the American people.\n\u201cI\u2019m currently preparing a draft of that in the event it is called upon and is necessary, but most importantly is supported by the American people,\u201d he said.\nFrom CNN\u2019s Sara Smart\n\n\nThe rabbi of the Chicago mother and daughter who are being held hostage in Israel feels reassured that US President Joe Biden and the United States are being supportive of all families.\nJudith Tai Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter, Natali Raanan, went to Israel to celebrate the 85th\u00a0birthday of Natali Raanan\u2019s grandmother. The mother and daughter are now being held hostage by Hamas.\nRabbi Mei Hecht told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on Monday night the family is beyond devastated as they continue to wait for any news on their family members.\nHecht described Judith as someone who is full of glee and joy. Before traveling to Israel, Hecht said Judith Raanan dropped off a pink prayer book for his 7-year-old daughter as a gift.\n\u201cThe fact that someone who lives next door to us, and is a part of our community, is a hostage in Israel makes the devastation and the pain and the grief that all Jews around the world are feeling that much more real,\u201d Rabbi Hecht said. \u201cIt brings it home in a way that is so much more a part of our life here, even though we're on the other side of the world.\u201d\nFrom CNN's Jennifer Hansler\nNearly 1,000 US citizens and their immediate family members departed from Israel on US government-chartered transport, a State Department spokesperson told CNN.\nThe spokesperson said the US government had offered \u201cmore than 4,000 seats on US government-chartered transport by air and sea to US citizens and their immediate family members\u201d since last Friday.\nNotably, however, the spokesperson said \u201cthe departure options we have offered have generally departed at half capacity or less.\u201d\nUS government-facilitated flights are expected to continue on a rolling basis from Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport through at least Thursday, the spokesperson said.\n\u00a0More than 3,000 additional US citizens have said \u201cthey successfully departed Israel and the West Bank using commercial air, via the land border, or other means,\u201d according to the spokesperson.\nMeanwhile, Americans in Gaza told CNN they have had no luck getting into Egypt through the Rafah crossing, despite indications from US officials that it may be opening.

The IDF is currently investigating and as always prioritizes accuracy,\" the spokesperson said according to an NBC News report.\n\"We urge everyone to proceed with caution while reporting about a terror organization,\" the spokesperson added.\n\u2014 Amanda Macias\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will travel to Cairo, Egypt on Thursday to discuss humanitarian aid with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi.\n\"In order to move humanitarian aid through Gaza, we need safe passage,\" United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric said during a press briefing announcing Guterres' trip.\n\"There are intense discussions going on which we're involved with a number of parties in order to try to get the most basic humanitarian aid in as quickly as possible, and that's food, water, medicine,\" Dujarric added.\nDujarric declined to comment when asked by reporters at the United Nations if Guterres would travel to Israel.\n\u2014 Amanda Macias\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan slammed the airstrike on a hospital in Gaza, placing the blame squarely on Israel.\n\"Hitting a hospital containing women, children and innocent civilians is the latest example of Israel's attacks devoid of the most basic human values,\" Erdogan wrote in a social media post on X, according to a Google translation.\n\"I invite all humanity to take action to stop this unprecedented brutality in Gaza,\" he added.\nAn Israeli Defense Forces spokesman said the airstrike was under investigation but added that the explosion could be from a Hamas rocket.\n\u2014 Amanda Macias\nA Hamas official told NBC News that the group is prepared to release all civilian hostages in an hour if Israel halts airstrikes in Gaza.\nIt was not immediately clear how many civilian hostages the militant group has kidnapped since the war began on Oct. 7.\n\u2014 Amanda Macias\nThe White House said President Joe Biden spoke with the bipartisan congressional delegation led by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck (D-N.Y.) that went to Israel over the weekend.\nRepublican Senator Bill Cassidy of Louisana, Democrat Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Democrat Senator Jacky Rosen of Nevada and Republican Senator Mitt Romney of Utah were forced to shelter in place during their trip due to air raid sirens.\n\u2014 Amanda Macias\nThe Gaza Health Ministry said an Israeli airstrike hit a hospital in central Gaza and has killed at least 500 people, according to an AP report.\nIf confirmed, the Israeli airstrike would be by far the deadliest since 2008, according to the AP.\nPalestinian Health Ministry spokesman Ashraf Al Qudra said there were about 500 victims in the attack, NBC reported. He estimated that between 200 to 300 were killed. It is unclear when Al Qudra made his statement.\nIsraeli Defense Forces spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that the reports of an Israeli airstrike against a hospital in Gaza are still under investigation.\n\"There are a lot of airstrikes, a lot of failed rockets, and a lot of fake reports by Hamas,\" Hagari said according to a Times of Israel report.\n\u2014 Amanda Macias\nOlena Zelenska, the first lady of Ukraine, spoke to Israeli First Lady Michal Herzog to express condolences to the victims of the Hamas terrorist attack on Oct. 7.\n\"We feel your pain, the pain of every family in Israel. Ukrainians in all corners of our country express support for the people of Israel, and I want to convey this to you. These and many other manifestations of solidarity confirm how close our peoples are in both joy and sorrow,\" Zelenska said, according to a readout of the call provided by the Ukrainian government.\nZelenska said that at least 13 Ukrainian citizens were confirmed dead since the start of the Isael-Hamas conflict.\n\u2014 Amanda Macias\nThe French ministry of foreign affairs has condemned the \"ignoble\" first video posted by Palestinian militant group Hamas, which appears to depict a hostage.\nIt is not immediately clear when the footage was shot.\nThe footage, released on Tuesday, features 21-year-old French-Israeli Mia Schem, who was abducted during the terror attacks of Oct. 7. She is shown receiving care for an arm injury, before she addresses the camera, requesting to be released.\nReferencing the capture of hostages, the French ministry of foreign affairs said on Tuesday in a CNBC-translated social media post that \"France denounces the ignoble video staging of Hamas.\"\nThe ministry added that 21 French nationals were killed, with another 11 still missing.\n\u2014 Ruxandra Iordache\nEgypt's Minister of Foreign Affairs Sameh Shoukry has denounced attempts to \"misrepresent\" Cairo's position on opening the Rafah crossing that borders the north African country with the Gaza Strip.\n\"Attempts to misrepresent Egypt's position about Rafah Crossing are unacceptable \u2026 the crossing has been subject to 4 aerial bombing by the Israeli side and hence its not functioning normally\u2026 the crossing has never been officially closed by [Egypt],\" Shoukry said in a BBC interview, according to a foreign ministry spokesperson on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\"We are in constant contact with all UN agencies to extract a safe passage for the relief aid.. There is no yet any sort of authorisation for a safe passage from the other side of the Crossing,\" Shoukry added.\nU.N. and human rights agencies have called for the Rafah crossing to be opened to allow for the evacuation of residents of the Gaza Strip and foreign nationals as the local humanitarian crisis deepened. Cairo has said that Israel has failed to take a position that would facilitate opening the crossing, amid ongoing attacks.\n\u2014 Ruxandra Iordache\nThe Israeli air force said on Tuesday that it has killed a senior Hamas commander. \nIn a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, it said the air strike attack on Ayman Nofal was conducted in collaboration with Shin Bet, Israel's intelligence agency.\n\"Air Force fighter jets, under joint intelligence guidance with the Shin Bet, killed one of the senior members of the Hamas terrorist organization, Ayman Nofal, who served as the commander of the Hamas central camps brigade in the Gaza Strip, and as the former head of Hamas's military intelligence,\" it said, according to a Google translation. \nHamas' armed wing Izz el-Deen Al-Qassam Brigades announced Nofal's death earlier Tuesday in a post on Telegram.\n\u2014 Karen Gilchrist\nA senior Hamas armed commander was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza, Hamas' armed wing Izz el-Deen Al-Qassam Brigades said Tuesday on Telegram, according to a Google translation.\nNofal was a member of the General Military Council and commander of the Central Brigade in the al-Qassam Brigades, the Palestinian militant group said.\nCNBC was unable to independently verify the reports.\nIsrael has been targeting the strategic positions of Hamas in a bid to strip away its military capabilities, following the group's terrorist attacks of Oct. 7.\n\u2014 Karen Gilchrist\nJordan's King Abdullah II will host a four-way summit in Amman, reuniting U.S. President Joe Biden, his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, the Jordanian royal house said on social media.\nThe meeting will \"discuss dangerous developments in Gaza, its regional impact, & ensuring provision of aid into the Strip.\"\nBiden will head to Jordan on Wednesday, after a first stop in Tel Aviv and an anticipated meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A spate of high-profile U.S. officials have visited Israel to express solidarity since the Hamas terror attacks of Oct. 7, with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken making the voyage on two occasions. Blinken has also met with Abbas.\nThe bolstered U.S. diplomatic foray into the Middle East comes amid humanitarian concerns over Israel's retaliatory siege of the Gaza Strip and broader fears that the Israeli-Hamas war will ripple into the region.\n\u2014 Ruxandra Iordache\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency\u00a0for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) is no longer able to provide aid to the civilians of the besieged Gaza Strip, amid a deepening dearth of fuel, clean water and medical supplies, spokesperson Tamara Alrifai told CNBC.\n\"As we speak, UNRWA, the largest aid agency in Gaza, is no longer able to assist and protect civilians, especially those who have taken shelter in our schools and in our buildings. We do not have the supplies, we do not have water, clean drinking water, we do not have food, we do not have hygiene kits,\" she said, noting that UNWRA staff have lost the ability to move freely on Gaza territories without fear of being targeted.\nThe 140-square-mile enclave has been under siege by Israel since the start of last week, following a terror attack perpetuated by Palestinian militant group Hamas. Fifteen UNRWA staff members have been killed in the Gaza Strip since the start of hostilities, Alrifai said.\nResidents have lost access to Israeli supplies of food, electricity, fuel and water \u2014 and the only operating power plant of the Gaza Strip has also exhausted its fuel. The local health system is collapsing, lacking the necessary electricity resources and medical equipment.\nThis deficit threatens to be compounded by a potential ground incursion from Israel into the region, humanitarian agencies say.\n\"We have to get aid in,\" Alrifai said. \"The safest way is to establish what we call in the humanitarian world a humanitarian cessation of hostilities. This is an agreed window where all parties agree that convoys of aid will be going into Gaza and that whoever receives them ... will not be targeted while they're organizing a distribution of water and food.\"\nShe said that the urgent priorities were to procure fuel to generate electricity and subsequently purify water supplies.\nThe international community has yet to be able to broker a corridor to receive such supplies, or to allow the evacuation of stranded Gaza residents or foreign nationals into Egypt, through the shuttered Rafah crossing.\n\u2014 Ruxandra Iordache\nThe Israel Defense Forces is advancing its campaign to eliminate the military abilities of Palestinian militant group Hamas, a spokesperson said, but the next step may not be a long-anticipated ground incursion.\n\"We are preparing for the next stages of war. We haven't said what they will be. Everybody's talking about the ground offensive. It might be something different,\" the IDF's Lt Colonel Richard Hecht told reporters, according to Reuters.\nExpectations have mounted that Israel will launch a ground offensive into the besieged Gaza Strip, which it has sealed off from its electricity, fuel, food and water supplies. Israeli troops have amassed at the border, with the IDF on Friday last week instructing the residents of Gaza City to evacuate south of the Wadi Gaza wetlands.\nBut there has been no ground offensive as yet amid widespread warnings from human rights groups that a potential Israeli incursion could dramatically exacerbate the humanitarian crisis taking place in the Gaza Strip.\n\"The bottom line is that we will commence the enhanced military activities when the timing suits the goal,\" IDF spokesperson Jonathan Conricus said in an overnight press update.\nU.S. President Joe Biden will follow in the footsteps of Secretary of State Antony Blinken with a visit to Tel Aviv, Israel on Wednesday.\n\u2014 Ruxandra Iordache\nIran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei on Tuesday said the Israeli government \"must be tried\" for its actions against the Palestinian people, in Google-translated comments reported by Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.\n\"If the crimes of [Israel] continue, the Muslims and the resistance forces will become impatient and no one will be able to stop them,\" he said. Iran refers to groups that oppose Israel \u2014 including Palestinian militant group Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah, which it sponsors \u2014 as participants in a resistance movement.\nIsrael last week launched a complete siege of the Gaza Strip and instructed those in the northern half of the region to evacuate south, following bloody terrorist attacks by Hamas on Oct. 7. Iran has repeatedly called for aid and relief for the Palestinian people, while celebrating but denying involvement in the Hamas offensive.\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi has stressed that the so-called resistance groups are independent in their decision-making, but Tehran's Foreign Minister Hossein\u00a0Amirabdollahian on Monday warned that this resistance front could proceed with \"pre-emptive action\" in the \"coming hours.\"\nFears have mounted over the possibility of the contagion of the Israeli-Hamas conflict within the Middle East.\n\"It is in everyone's interest to prevent a regional spillover. Urged Iran to use its influence to avoid regional escalation,\" EU top diplomat Josep Borrell said on social media on Monday, after speaking with Amirabdollahian.\n\u2014 Ruxandra Iordache\nIsrael's Gaza evacuation order could amount to a crime of \"forcible transfer\" in breach of international law, according to a spokesperson for the U.N. human rights office.\n\"We are concerned that this order, combined with the imposition of a complete siege of Gaza, may not be considered as lawful temporary evacuation and would therefore amount to a forcible transfer of civilians in breach of international law,\" Ravina Shamdasani said, according to Reuters.\nThe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court lists the \"deportation or forcible transfer of population\" as a type of crime against humanity, which it punishes. The Palestinian Authority accepted the Rome Statute in 2015, \"thereby accepting the jurisdiction of the Court over alleged crimes committed in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014,\" the ICC says.\nIsrael has signed but not ratified the Rome Statute and contests the ICC's authority to carry out such an investigation.\nHuman rights organizations have decried the humanitarian impact of the siege and resource deprivation inflicted by Israel against the Gaza Strip since last week in its retaliatory strikes against Palestinian militant group Hamas.\n\u2014 Ruxandra Iordache\nPalestinian militant group Hamas said its official appointed to oversee crossings out of the Gaza Strip has been killed in an Israeli air strike.\nGeneral Fouad Abu Butihan died in a strike on Nuseirat in central Gaza, Hamas said on Telegram, according to a Google translation. CNBC could not independently verify the report.\nThe besieged Gaza Strip is bordered by Israel, the sea and the Rafah crossing leading into Egypt.\nIsraeli military has said it is targeting Hamas' armed positions in the Gaza Strip with the aim of stripping away all of the group's military capabilities.\n\u2014 Ruxandra Iordache\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday warned Iran and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah not to become involved in the ongoing Israel-Hamas hostilities.\n\"I expressly warn Hezbollah and Iran not to intervene in the conflict,\" Scholz said Tuesday, in commented reported by Reuters. He spoke after a meeting with Jordanian King Abdullah in Berlin.\nScholz is expected to visit Israel in an expression of solidarity on Tuesday, according to domestic and international media reports \u2014 a day before the scheduled arrival of U.S. President Joe Biden.\nThe international community has largely condemned the Oct.7 terrorist attacks perpetrated by Iran-backed Palestinian militant group Hamas, with fear now mounting over a potential spill-over of the conflict into the wider Middle East following repeated fire exchanges between Israel and Hezbollah.\nIran's foreign minister on Monday evening warned that so-called resistance groups could take \"pre-emptive action\" against Israel in \"the coming hours,\" without supplying details.\n\u2014 Ruxandra Iordache\nRoughly half a million Israeli people have been internally displaced, largely \"at their own merit and at their own initiative\" to avoid civilian damage in the ongoing conflict with Palestinian militant group Hamas, Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson Jonathan Conricus said during an overnight press update.\n\"We've evacuated all of southern Israel close to the border, close to Gaza. Most of Sderot has been evacuated, parts of Ashkelon has been evacuated, and those are cities with tens of thousands of people,\" he said, noting that official evacuation instructions have now been sent to Sderot and other communities near the Gaza Strip , while the residents of more than 20 Israeli settlements in the north have been displaced.\nIsrael's Ministry of Defense on Monday said it would evacuate civilians from 28 communities near northern Israel up to 2 kilometers (1.24 miles) from the Lebanese border to state-funded guesthouses.\nThe internal Israeli displacements come amid an anticipated Israeli ground incursion into the Gaza Strip, along with ongoing fire exchanges with Lebanese militant group Hezbollah since last week.\nThey also come around the same time as evacuations in the embattled Gaza Strip, where more than 1 million people \u2014 or nearly half the local population \u2014 were internally displaced, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees said in its latest report on Monday. \nThe U.N. expressed alarm at the Israeli military's evacuation directive to the 1.1 million residents of northern Gaza and warned it was \"impossible\" for such a human movement to take place without \"devastating humanitarian consequences.\"\n\u2014 Ruxandra Iordache\nIran's foreign minister on Monday evening warned that \"pre-emptive action\" from so-called resistance forces could be imminent against Israel in the short term.\n\"The resistance front is capable of waging a long-term war with the enemy [Israel] ... in the coming hours, we can expect a pre-emptive action by the resistance front,\" Hossein\u00a0Amirabdollahian said on state TV without supplying further details, in comments reported by Reuters.\n\"All options are open and we cannot be indifferent to the war crimes committed against the people of Gaza,\" he added.\nStriking a discordant note, Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi earlier on Monday said that the alleged resistance group active against Israel are independent and make their own decisions, in Google-translated comments reported by Iran's state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.\nIran has historically backed Hamas and has celebrated but denied involvement in the Palestinian militant group's terrorist attacks of Oct. 7. Like many Arab countries in the Middle East region, Tehran has supported the cause of the Palestinian people, and it has repeatedly called for aid and relief for the civilians of the besieged Gaza Strip enclosure.\nIranian officials have repeatedly warned of the possibility that the Israeli-Hamas hostilities could spill over into the Middle East, amid increasing fire exchanges between Israel and the Tehran-supported Hezbollah militant group in Lebanon. Like close ally Russia, Iran has attributed the current conflict between Israel and Hamas to a failure of Western \u2014 and particularly U.S. \u2014 diplomacy.\n\u2014 Ruxandra Iordache\nIsrael's military continues to prepare for an \"enhanced military operation in Gaza\" and is monitoring the evacuation of civilians from the northern part of the Gaza Strip south of the Wadi Gaza wetlands, Israel Defense Forces spokesperson Jonathan Conricus said in a press update.\nIsrael declared full siege of the Gaza Strip at the start of last week, depriving it of Israel's water, electricity, food and fuel supplies within two days of a multi-pronged terrorist attack delivered on Oct. 7 by Palestinian militant group Hamas. The timing of Israel's anticipated ground incursion remains under question.\n\"As always military activity is timed according to many variables, some of them physical, some of them related to humanitarian constraints, some of them related to the state of your enemy and the state of your own readiness. But the bottom line is that we will commence the enhanced military activities when the timing suits the goal,\" Conricus said, stressing that the \"aim of this war is to completely dismantle Hamas and their military capabilities.\"\nSeveral human rights organizations have decried the imminent offensive and Israel's ongoing blockade of the Gaza Strip, citing concerns over a worsening humanitarian crisis.\nIn addition to combating Hamas, Conricus said that the IDF has been carrying out military responses \"in kind\" to attacks coming from Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, with which it has been exchanging fire since last week. Hezbollah has expressed its readiness to get involved in the Israeli-Hamas hostilities, amid growing fears that the conflict will engulf the broader Middle East.\n\"Our message to Hezbollah is that any aggression, any escalation to the situation would not serve the purposes neither of Hezbollah and definitely not those of Lebanon and the Lebanese people,\" Conricus said.\n\u2014 Ruxandra Iordache\nPresident Joe Biden said he will travel to Israel on Wednesday to \"stand in solidarity in the face of Hamas's brutal terrorist attack.\"\n\"I'll then travel to Jordan to address dire humanitarian needs, meet with leaders, and make clear that Hamas does not stand for Palestinians' right to self-determination,\" Biden wrote on X, the social media platform previously known as Twitter.\n\u2014 Amanda Macias\nEvery Arab leader who met U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in the last few days highlighted the importance of dealing with the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, a senior State Department official told NBC News.\nThe official said President Joe Biden told Blinken to return to Tel Aviv, Israel following his whirlwind trip through the six Arab countries: Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.\nAfter nine hours of negotiations with Israel, Blinken announced that both sides \"agreed to develop a plan that will enable humanitarian aid from donor nations and multi-lateral organizations to reach civilians in Gaza \u2014 and them alone.\"\nThe new U.S. envoy for Middle East humanitarian issues, David Satterfield, is set to meet Israeli officials on Tuesday to see if they can get the plan worked out, the official added.\n\u2014 Joanna Tan\nThe top U.S. general overseeing American forces in the Middle East made an unannounced trip to Israel on Tuesday, saying he hoped to ensure its military has what it needs as it fights a deepening war against Palestinian militant group Hamas.\nThe trip by Army General Michael \"Erik\" Kurilla, head of U.S. Central Command, is the latest by a senior U.S. official to Israel ahead of an expected ground assault by Israel's military in Gaza.

Powell and Amir Vera, CNN\nOur live coverage of the\u00a0conflict in Israel and Gaza has moved here.\nFrom CNN staff\nThe US, Egypt and Israel have all signaled readiness for aid to begin moving into Gaza, following a high-profile visit to Israel by US President Joe Biden. \nThe glimmer of hope for civilian relief in Gaza comes one day after a devastating hospital blast in the enclave that likely killed hundreds and infuriated the region.\nHere are other headlines you should know:\nFrom CNN\u2019s Kathleen Magramo and Sophie Jeong\nA fourth Filipino citizen has been confirmed dead following Hamas' October 7 attack in Israel, the official Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported Thursday, citing authorities.\nThe victim was a caregiver at a communal settlement, PNA reported.\nTwo Filipino citizens remain missing, according to officials.\nOn Wednesday, 16 Filipino workers and a child returned to the Philippines from Israel, PNA reported.\nFrom CNN's Kayla Tausche\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden plans to argue the US should continue funding wars in both Ukraine and Israel during an Oval Office address Thursday, according to two administration officials.\nThe primetime address will take place the eve of the White House requesting north of $100 billion from Congress to deliver aid and resources to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the US border with Mexico. Biden is expected to make the argument that supporting Ukraine and Israel is a matter of US national security at a time when the world is at an inflection point.\nPublic opinion has been mixed on the conflicts.\u00a0In a recent CNN poll,\u00a0nearly all respondents were sympathetic with the Israeli people in the wake of surprise attacks launched by Hamas, but there was no clear consensus on the right level of US involvement. One-third (35%) said the US is providing the right amount of assistance \u2013 and another 36% were unsure whether the level of US assistance is appropriate. The US has long provided security assistance with Israel, which receives roughly $4 billion annually under a 10-year memorandum of understanding. The new request would provide billions more.\nBy contrast, support to sustain aid to Ukraine has waned significantly.\u00a0An August CNN poll\u00a0found 55% of respondents said Congress should not pass more funding to aid Ukraine. The partisan divide has been deepening, too: Nearly three-quarters of Republicans opposed more funding for Ukraine, while 62% of Democrats supported it.\nSince Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the White House and Congress have provided more than $75 billion in funding to Kyiv, according to the Kiel\u00a0Institute for the World Economy.\nThe Biden administration in August delivered its last so-called supplemental funding request, which encapsulates unique requests beyond traditional government programs. The proposal requested $24.1 billion to aid Ukraine through the end of the year, but Congress failed to approve it during a process to greenlight short-term federal funding.\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen pledged to European leaders that the US would be able to secure support for additional aid and, in an interview with Sky News, said Washington could afford financing two wars at once.\nFrom CNN staff\n\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Wednesday released drone video recorded over the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza a day after the deadly blast.\nDuring the video an Israeli drone operator can be heard describing in Hebrew the layout of hospital buildings.\n\"This here, there is nothing here,\" the drone operator says, according to a CNN translation.\nGaza officials have blamed Israel for the blast, which the Palestinian Ministry of Health says killed hundreds of civilians.\nBut the IDF rejected the allegation, claiming the blast was caused by a \"failed rocket launch\" by Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants.\nCNN cannot independently confirm what caused the explosion.\n\nFrom CNN's Sharon Braithwaite and journalist Magdy Samaan \nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and US President Joe Biden discussed in a phone call Wednesday ways to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza through the Rafah border crossing, the Egyptian Presidency said in a statement.\nThe talks between the two leaders focused \"on the humanitarian situation in Gaza and ways to facilitate the implementation of humanitarian aid,\" according to the statement.\nBiden told reporters on Air Force One that el-Sisi agreed to allow 20 trucks through the key crossing.\nEgypt's statement said officials in the two nations are coordinating with international humanitarian organizations \u2014 supervised by the United Nations \u2014 to deliver aid.\n\"Biden expresses his thanks and appreciation for the efforts of the Egyptian leadership towards achieving peace and stability in the region,\" the Egyptian statement said. \nFrom CNN\u2019s Casey Tolan, Matthew Chance, Florence Davey-Attlee, Scott Glover and Curt Devine\n\n\nWhen Hamas militants broke through the Gaza fence in this month\u2019s unprecedented attack on Israel, the kibbutz of Mefalsim \u2014 less than 2 miles from the border \u2014 was on the front lines. Toting AK-47 rifles and grenade launchers, one group of militants headed straight for the community\u2019s gates, while another group moved to destroy its generator, according to security videos and local residents.\nThat precision, local Israeli security personnel say, was no accident: The fighters seemed to have known exactly where they were headed.\nCNN has reviewed documents that Israeli officials say were Hamas attack plans, which suggest that the group collected remarkably granular detail on its targets. But neither of the attacks went according to plan \u2013 thanks in part to a handful of volunteer guards who defended their neighbors in dramatic firefights.\nPhotos of the plan to attack Mefalsim were posted online by an Israeli first responder group, which said it was recovered from the body of a slain Hamas fighter. Two local Israeli security personnel told CNN they independently saw photos of the plan, and it closely matched the Hamas fighters\u2019 tactics during the attack.\nThe color-coded document includes detailed information about the kibbutz\u2019s guards and security. It says that one group of militants would break through the community\u2019s fence, while others were ordered to \u201ccapture soldiers and civilians and to keep hostages\u201d for negotiation.\nYarden Reskin, a member of Mefalsim\u2019s volunteer security force who spent hours exchanging fire with militants \u2013 helping prevent any deaths inside the community \u2013 said he was shocked by the level of detail.\nAnother purported Hamas document laying out plans to attack the nearby kibbutz of Sa\u2019ad, which CNN obtained from a senior Israeli government official, was even more chilling. It listed the attackers\u2019 goal as \u201cinflicting the maximum possible human casualties.\u201d\nLike in Mefalsim, the plans didn\u2019t come to fruition, with a first responder group and a local resident telling CNN that no residents had died inside Sa\u2019ad.\nThe difference between the detailed plans and what occurred on the ground is a sign of the chaos that spread during the attack, as Hamas fighters encountered far less resistance from the Israeli military than they expected. Despite the billions of dollars Israel has spent securing its border and developing one of the world\u2019s most renowned intelligence operations, its armed forces were caught off guard.\nRead more on the foiled plot on on one kibbutz.\nFrom CNN's John Miller\nAs anger rises across the Middle East, Secretary of State Antony Blinken sent a State Department cable to all US embassies and consulates across the world Wednesday.\nHe ordered diplomatic security officers to convene each embassies' security committee to conduct emergency reviews of its' security to determine if it needs to be ramped up. \nBlinken\u2019s cable \u2014 obtained by CNN \u2014 ordered the State Department\u2019s Regional Security Officers (RSOs) to consider whether messages to Americans in those countries need advising of potential areas to avoid or precautions to take. All embassies were directed to report back to the State Department in Washington on whatever steps were being taken.\nCNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.\nCNN reported earlier Wednesday about steps taken at numerous consulates and embassies in the region, including that the US consulate in Adana, Turkey, \u201cwill remain closed to the public until further notice\u201d amid ongoing protests, and that the\u00a0US embassy in Beirut advised Americans to avoid the Awkar area also due to protests.\u00a0\nIn the past week, the State Department has raised the travel advisory to the highest level for Israel and Lebanon to warn Americans against going there, and has authorized the departure of some non-emergency US government personnel and family members from those countries.\nMeanwhile, law enforcement remains on very high alert across the US.\u00a0\nThe FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, along with the National Counterterrorism Center issued a Joint Intelligence Bulletin Wednesday sharing information and a threat assessment advising state and local law enforcement agencies.\u00a0The bulletin,  sent Wednesday and obtained by CNN, specifies that \"lone offenders inspired by, or reacting to, the ongoing Israel-HAMAS conflict pose the most likely threat to Americans.\"\u00a0\nThe bulletin also notes that \u201cthe FBI has seen an increase in reports of threats against faith communities, particularly Jewish and Muslim communities.\u201d \nThe joint bulletin goes on to say that while Hamas has not specifically called for attacks on US soil, it notes that other foreign terrorist organizations have called for attacks in the US and that \u201cmay prompt homegrown extremists\u201d to target attacks in the United States at Israeli, Jewish or US Government targets.\nCNN's Jenny Hansler contributed to this report\nFrom CNN's Paul P. Murphy\nVideo from an Al Jazeera\u00a0news camera appears to show\u00a0a rocket fired from a Gaza\u00a0explosion in\u00a0flight\u00a0above Gaza City, which happened\u00a0moments before an explosion is seen at\u00a0Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital.\u00a0\nIt is\u00a0still\u00a0not clear if they are related.\u00a0\nCNN is continuing to conduct its own investigation into the blast at the\u00a0hospital, and has not yet made any final conclusions.\nCNN began reviewing this video\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0shortly after the explosion.\u00a0Since then, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has pointed to this video as evidence that it was not responsible for the explosion at the hospital.\u00a0\nCNN\u00a0referenced\u00a0nearby buildings in the video to\u00a0geolocate them\u00a0to an area just west of the hospital.\u00a0\nThe video was broadcast live from an east-facing Al Jazeera camera and captures the rocket trail rising into the air just a few seconds after it was launched.\u00a0The time on the screen reads 6:59 p.m local time.\nBy geolocating where the Al Jazeera video was taken from, and the direction it's capturing, CNN has determined the rocket was fired from an area south of Gaza City.\u00a0The rocket can be\u00a0seen in the video continuing to rise, until it suddenly veers straight up in the air.\nThe rocket then is seen making a sharp turn back toward the direction\u00a0from\u00a0where it was fired.\u00a0A streak of fire is seen as the rocket flies significantly faster, continuing back toward the direction it was fired.\u00a0\u00a0\nSuddenly, the rocket is seen exploding mid-flight, in the\u00a0air high above Gaza City.\u00a0The rocket trail is no longer\u00a0visible.\u00a0From the video, it is unclear where the rocket ultimately fell.\nRetired Col. Cedric Leighton told CNN after reviewing the video that \"it's consistent with a malfunctioning rocket.\"\u00a0\nMoments\u00a0after the mid-air explosion, a flash of light is seen in the video in the east toward the ground.\u00a0As the camera pans down, an\u00a0explosion in another area of east Gaza City is seen.\u00a0\nThen, a second flash of light \u2014\u00a0an\u00a0explosion \u2014 is seen at the\u00a0Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital complex.\nThere is only one rocket trail seen in the video.\u00a0If the rising rocket was intercepted by another rocket, there would be another rocket trail.\u00a0\nThe Iron Dome system is programmed to only intercept rockets that are about to land in Israel. The location of this explosion is in the middle of Gaza and an intercept that far into Gaza would be unusual, according to CNN\u2019s Jerusalem correspondent Hadas Gold.\nPlease enable JavaScript for a better experience.","45":"Live\nIsrael-Hamas war\nLive\nGOP debate highlights\nBy Kathleen Magramo, Andrew Raine, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Peter Wilkinson, Sophie Tanno, Tori B. Powell and Adrienne Vogt, CNN\nOur coverage of the Israel-Hamas war has moved here.\nIndependent analysis by the Canadian Forces Intelligence Command indicates with \"a high degree of confidence that Israel did not strike the Al-Ahli hospital\" in Gaza City on October 17, according to a statement released by\u00a0Canada's Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces Saturday.\n\"This assessment is informed by an analysis of the blast damage to the hospital complex, including adjacent buildings and the area surrounding the hospital, as well as the flight pattern of the incoming munition,\" the statement added. \nThe\u00a0blast that ripped through\u00a0the packed Al-Ahli Hospital killed hundreds of people. Palestinian militants and the Israeli government have dueling accounts over who is culpable.\nThe Israel Defense Forces\u00a0(IDF) has dropped flyers in the Sabrah neighborhood of Gaza City that urgently warn residents to evacuate to the south or face the possibility of being considered \"a partner for the terrorist organization,\u201d according to a CNN translation.\u00a0\nThe flyer reads in Arabic:\nThe IDF confirmed it had dropped the flyers in a statement, adding there was\u00a0\"no intention to consider those who have not evacuated from the affected area of fighting as a member of the terrorist group.\" \nThe IDF \"treats civilians as such, and does not target them,\" the statement said. \nThe IDF told CNN that the translation of the flyer from Arabic that \u201chas spread online\u201d was imprecise, but it did not elaborate.\nThe United Nations has said that the Israeli order to\u00a0evacuate the entire population of northern Gaza, which is approximately 1.1 million people,\u00a0is \"impossible\" without causing major humanitarian consequences.\nThere are currently 2.2 million people in Gaza.\u00a0\nThe IDF said they continue to urge residents in northern\u00a0Gaza to evacuate \u201cfor their own safety.\u201d\u00a0\nThe US military is sending more missile defense systems to the Middle East and placing additional US troops on prepare-to-deploy orders\u00a0in response to escalations throughout the region in recent days.\nThe order for troops to prepare for deployment is meant \u201cto increase their readiness and ability to quickly respond as required,\u201d he said.\nBoth the THAAD and Patriots systems are air defense systems designed to shoot down short, medium and intermediate ballistic missiles.\n\"These\u00a0steps will\u00a0bolster regional deterrence efforts, increase force protection for US forces in the region,\u00a0and assist in the defense of Israel,\u201d he added.\n\n\nThe Israeli military said it launched an airstrike early Sunday local time against a mosque in the West Bank city of Jenin to thwart what it called \"an imminent terror attack.\" \nIsrael Defense Forces spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told CNN the IDF had new intelligence that \"suggested there was an imminent attack coming from a joint Hamas and Islamic Jihad squad\" making preparations from an underground command center in the Al-Ansar mosque. \nA few months ago, there was significant fighting in Jenin for about two days, and Conricus said during an IDF operation there, they discovered the \"terrorist\" tunnel system inside the mosque.\nThe IDF and Israel Securities Authority (ISA) also put out a\u00a0statement Saturday confirming the strike on the tunnel.\nThe statement said Hamas and Islamic Jihad operatives had been responsible for several \"terror attacks\" over the past few months and were plotting a new, \"imminent\" attack.\n\"Intel was recently received which indicated that the terrorists, that were neutralized, were organizing an imminent terror attack. The mosque was used by the terrorists as a command center to plan the attacks and as a base for their execution,\" the statement said.\nFrom CNN's Rhea Mogul\nA family member of an Israeli man who remains missing after being kidnapped by Hamas from an Israeli kibbutz two weeks ago said they live with hope that he will be released soon and reunited with his two young daughters. \nOmri Miran was taken by Hamas militants in front of his wife and daughters, who survived the brutal attack, his brother-in-law, Moshe Lavi, told CNN. \nIt has been a \"dreadful\" two weeks, Lavi said, adding he worries for his sister and her two children, a two-year-old and six-month-old. \nHe said that his two-year-old niece has been asking about her father and when he is coming home. \nDuring the October 7 attack, Hamas militants killed more than 1,400 people, including civilians and soldiers, according to Israeli authorities, and abducted around 200 more. It was the most deadly attack by militants in Israel\u2019s 75-year history and has been described as the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust.\nLavi, who served in a special unit for the Ministry of Defense, said the trauma his two-year-old niece has experienced will likely stay with her for a long time. \nHamas released two American hostages, Judith Tai Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter, Natalie Raanan, on Friday, giving Lavi's family hope that Miran will soon return home. \nFrom CNN's Nic Robertson\nAt least 13 Palestinians, including five children, were reported killed in an Israeli security forces' operation that lasted 28 hours in a West Bank refugee camp, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA). \nThe operation took place in Nur Shams, the UNRWA director in the West Bank, Adam Bouloukos, said. \nThe statement added that the UNRWA has suspended schools, health services, and solid waste collections in the camp.\u00a0\nEarlier in the day, the Palestinian Ministry of Health reported that at least 84 Palestinians have been killed in the occupied West Bank since October 7.\u00a0\nFrom CNN staff\nThe Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, told IDF commanders Saturday that the military is readying an operation to enter Gaza and take out Hamas.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll enter the Gaza Strip. We\u2019ll embark on an operational and professional task to destroy Hamas operatives and infrastructures,\u201d the chief said in comments to the Golani Brigade of the IDF. He did not provide a specific timeframe.\nMeanwhile, the IDF will increase airstrikes on Gaza,\u00a0IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said Saturday.\u00a0\u201cWe will increase our strikes, minimize the risk to our troops in the next stages of the war, and we will intensify the strikes, starting from today,\"\u00a0Hagari told reporters during a briefing in Tel Aviv.\nAirstrikes have killed at least 4,385 people in Gaza since Hamas launched its October 7 attack on Israel, according to the health ministry in Gaza.\nHere are other headlines you should know:\nFrom CNN's Paul P. Murphy,\u00a0Katie Polglase,\u00a0Benjamin Brown,\u00a0Gianluca Mezzofiore\u00a0and\u00a0Eliza Mackintosh\n\n\nIn the days since a\u00a0blast ripped through\u00a0the packed Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza City, killing hundreds of Palestinians and setting off dueling claims between Palestinian militants and the Israeli government over culpability are still raging. But forensic analysis of publicly available imagery and footage has begun to offer some clues as to what caused the explosion.\nCNN has reviewed dozens of videos posted on social media, aired on live broadcasts and filmed by a freelance journalist working for CNN in Gaza, as well as satellite imagery, to piece together what happened in as much detail as possible.\nWithout the ability to access the site and gather evidence from the ground, no conclusion can be definitive. But CNN\u2019s analysis suggests that a rocket launched from within Gaza broke up midair, and that the blast at the hospital was the result of part of the rocket landing at the hospital complex.\nWeapons and explosive experts with decades of experience assessing bomb damage, who reviewed the visual evidence, told CNN they believe this to be the most likely scenario \u2013 although they caution the absence of munition remnants or shrapnel from the scene made it difficult to be sure. All agreed that the available evidence of the damage at the site was not consistent with an Israeli airstrike.\nIsrael says that a \u201cmisfired\u201d rocket by militant group Islamic Jihad caused the blast, a claim that US President Joe Biden\u00a0said on Wednesday\u00a0is backed up by US intelligence. A spokesperson for the National Security Council later said that analysis of overhead imagery, intercepts and open-source information suggested that Israel is \u201cnot responsible.\u201d\nPalestinian officials and several Arab leaders nevertheless\u00a0accuse\u00a0Israel of hitting the hospital amid its ongoing airstrikes in Gaza. Islamic Jihad (or PIJ) \u2013 a rival group to Hamas \u2013 has denied responsibility.\nThe Israel-Hamas war has triggered a wave of misleading content and false claims online. That misinformation, coupled with the polarizing nature of the conflict, has made it difficult to sort fact from fiction.\nIn the past few days, a number of outlets have published investigations into the hospital blast. Some have reached diametrically different conclusions, reflecting the challenges of doing such analysis remotely.\nBut as more information surfaces, CNN\u2019s investigation \u2013 which includes a review of nighttime video of the explosion, and horrifying images of those injured and killed inside the hospital complex \u2013 is an effort to shed light on details of the blast beyond what Israel and the US have produced publicly.\nRead the CNN investigation in full here. \nPlease enable JavaScript for a better experience.","46":"Five armed Palestinian groups joined Hamas in the deadly 7 October attack on Israel after training together in military-style exercises from 2020 onwards, BBC News analysis shows.\nThe groups carried out joint drills in Gaza which closely resembled the tactics used during the deadly assault - including at a site less than 1km (0.6 miles) from the barrier with Israel - and posted them on social media. \nThey practised hostage-taking, raiding compounds and breaching Israel's defences during these exercises, the last of which was held just 25 days before the attack.\nBBC Arabic and BBC Verify have collated evidence which shows how Hamas brought together Gaza's factions to hone their combat methods - and ultimately execute a raid into Israel which has plunged the region into war. \nOn 29 December 2020, Hamas's overall leader Ismail Haniyeh declared the first of four drills codenamed Strong Pillar a \"strong message and a sign of unity\" between Gaza's various armed factions.\nAs the most powerful of Gaza's armed groups, Hamas was the dominant force in a coalition which brought together 10 other Palestinian factions in a war games-style exercise overseen by a \"joint operation room\".\nThe structure was set up in 2018 to coordinate Gaza's armed factions under a central command. \nPrior to 2018, Hamas had formally coordinated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Gaza's second largest armed faction and - like Hamas - a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries.\nHamas had also fought alongside other groups in previous conflicts, but the 2020 drill was billed in propaganda as evidence a wider array of groups were being unified.\nHamas's leader said the first drill reflected the \"permanent readiness\" of the armed factions.\nThe 2020 exercise was the first of four joint drills held over three years, each of which was documented in polished videos posted on public social media channels. \nThe BBC has visually identified 10 groups, including PIJ, by their distinctive headbands and emblems training alongside Hamas during the Strong Pillar drills in footage posted on the messaging app Telegram.\nFollowing the 7 October attack, five of the groups went on to post videos claiming to show them taking part in the assault. Three others issued written statements on Telegram claiming to have participated. \nThe role of these groups has come into sharp focus as pressure builds on Hamas to find dozens of women and children believed to have been taken as captives from Israel into Gaza by other factions on 7 October.\nThree groups - PIJ, the Mujahideen Brigades and Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades - claim to have seized Israeli hostages, alongside Hamas, on that day. \nEfforts to extend the temporary truce in Gaza were said to be hinging on Hamas locating those hostages.\nWhile these groups are drawn from a broad ideological spectrum ranging from hard-line Islamist to relatively secular, all shared a willingness to use violence against Israel.\nHamas statements repeatedly stressed the theme of unity between Gaza's disparate armed groups. The group suggested they were equal partners in the joint drills, whilst it continued to play a leading role in the plans to attack Israel.\nFootage from the first drill shows masked commanders in a bunker appearing to conduct the exercise, and begins with a volley of rocket fire.\nIt cuts to heavily armed fighters overrunning a mocked-up tank marked with an Israeli flag, detaining a crew member and dragging him away as a prisoner, as well as raiding buildings. \nWe know from videos and harrowing witness statements that both tactics were used to capture soldiers and target civilians on 7 October, when around 1,200 people were killed and an estimated 240 hostages were taken.\nThe second Strong Pillar drill was held almost exactly one year later.\nAyman Nofal, a commander in the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - the official name for Hamas's armed wing - said the aim of the exercise on 26 December 2021 was to \"affirm the unity of the resistance factions\".\nHe said the drills would \"tell the enemy that the walls and engineering measures on the borders of Gaza will not protect them\".\nAnother Hamas statement said the \"joint military manoeuvres\" were designed to \"simulate the liberation of settlements near Gaza\" - which is how the group refers to Israeli communities.\nThe exercise was repeated on 28 December 2022, and propaganda images of fighters practising clearing buildings and overrunning tanks in what appears to be a replica of a military base were published to mark the event.\nThe exercises were reported on in Israel, so it's inconceivable they were not being closely monitored by the country's extensive intelligence agencies.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have previously carried out air strikes to disrupt Hamas's training activities. In April 2023, they bombed the site used for the first Strong Pillar drill. \nWeeks before the attacks, female surveillance soldiers near the Gaza border reportedly warned of unusually high drone activity and that Hamas was training to take over observation posts with replicas of their positions.\nBut, according to reports in the Israeli media, they say they were ignored.\nBrigadier General Amir Avivi, a former IDF deputy commander in Gaza, told the BBC:  \"There was a lot of intelligence that they were doing this training - after all, the videos are public, and this was happening just hundreds of metres from the fence (with Israel).\"\nBut he said while the military knew about the drills, they \"didn't see what they were training for\".\nThe IDF said they \"eliminated\" Nofal on 17 October 2023, the first senior Hamas military leader to be killed during the conflict. \nHamas went to great lengths to make sure the drills were realistic.\nIn 2022, fighters practised storming a mock Israeli military base built just 2.6km (1.6 miles) from the Erez crossing, a route between Gaza and Israel controlled by the IDF.\nBBC Verify has pinpointed the site in the far north of Gaza, just 800m (0.5 miles) from the barrier, by matching geographic features seen in the training footage to aerial images of the area. As of November 2023, the site was still visible on Bing Maps.\nThe training camp was within 1.6km (1 mile) of an Israeli observation tower and an elevated observation box, elements in a security barrier Israel has spent hundreds of millions of dollars constructing.\nThe mock base is on land dug several metres below ground level, so it may not have been immediately visible to any nearby Israeli patrols - but the smoke rising from the explosions surely would have been, and the IDF is known to use aerial surveillance. \nHamas used this site to practise storming buildings, taking hostages at gunpoint and destroying security barriers.\nBBC Verify has used publicly available information - including satellite imagery - to locate 14 training sites at nine different locations across Gaza.\nThey even trained twice at a site less than 1.6 km (1 mile) from the United Nations' aid agency distribution centre, and which was visible in the background of an official video published by the agency in December 2022.\nOn 10 September 2023, the so-called joint committee room published images on its dedicated Telegram channel of men in military uniforms carrying out surveillance of military installations along the Gaza barrier.\nTwo days later, the fourth Strong Pillar military exercise was staged, and by 7 October, all the tactics that would be deployed in the unprecedented attack had been rehearsed.\nFighters were filmed riding in the same type of white Toyota pickup trucks which were seen roaming through southern Israel the following month.\nThe propaganda video shows gunmen raiding mock buildings and firing at dummy targets inside, as well as training to storm a beach using a boat and underwater divers. Israel has said it repelled attempted Hamas boat landings on its shores on 7 October.\nHowever, Hamas did not publicise its training with motorcycles and paragliders as part of the Strong Pillar propaganda. \nA training video posted by Hamas three days after 7 October shows fences and barriers being demolished to allow motorcycles to pass through, a tactic they used to reach communities in southern Israel. We have not identified similar earlier videos.\nFootage of fighters using paragliding equipment was also not published until the 7 October attack was under way.  \nIn a training video shared on the day of the attack, gunmen are seen landing in a mock kibbutz at an airstrip we have located to a site north of Rafah in southern Gaza.\nBBC Verify established it was recorded some time before 25 August 2022, and was stored in a computer file titled Eagle Squadron, the name Hamas uses for its aerial division - suggesting the paragliders plan was in the works for over a year. \nBefore 7 October, Hamas was thought to have about 30,000 fighters in the Gaza Strip, according to reports quoting IDF commanders. It was also thought that Hamas could draw on several thousands of fighters from smaller groups.\nHamas is by far the most powerful of the Palestinian armed groups, even without the support of other factions - suggesting its interest in galvanising the factions was driven by an attempt to secure broad support within Gaza at least as much as bolstering its own numbers.\nThe IDF has previously estimated 1,500 fighters joined the 7 October raids. The  Times of Israel reported earlier this month the IDF now believes the number was closer to 3,000.\nWhatever the true number, it means only a relatively small fraction of the total number of armed operatives in Gaza took part. It is not possible to verify precise numbers for how many fighters from smaller groups took part in the attack or the Strong Pillar drills.\nWhile Hamas was building cross-faction support in the build-up to the attack, Hisham Jaber, a former Brigadier General in the Lebanese army who is now a security analyst at the Middle East Centre for Studies and Research, said he believed only Hamas was aware of the ultimate plan, and it was \"probable [they] asked other factions to join on the day\".\nAndreas Krieg, a senior lecturer in security studies at Kings College London, told the BBC: \"While there was centralised planning, execution was de-centralised, with each squad operationalising the plan as they saw fit.\"\nHe said people inside Hamas were said to be surprised by the weakness of Israel's defences, and assessed militants had likely bypassed Israel's surveillance technology by communicating offline. \nHugh Lovatt, a Middle East analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Israel would have been aware of the joint training drills but \"reached the wrong conclusion\", assessing they amounted to the \"standard\" activity of paramilitary groups in the Palestinian territories, rather than being \"indicative of a looming large-scale attack\".\nAsked about the issues raised in this article, the Israel Defense Forces said it was \"currently focused on eliminating the threat from the terrorist organisation Hamas\" and questions about any potential failures \"will be looked into in a later stage\".\nIt could be several years until Israel formally reckons with whether it missed opportunities to prevent the 7 October massacre.\nThe ramifications for its military, intelligence services and government could be seismic.  \nAdditional reporting by Paul Brown, Kumar Malhotra and Abdirahim Saeed.
