"This video can not be played The BBC's Wyre Davies said it was a ""devastating night"" for the Socialists The opposition in Venezuela has won a majority of seats in the National Assembly, overturning nearly two decades of dominance by the Socialists of President Nicolas Maduro. Five hours after polling ended, the National Electoral Council announced the opposition had won 99 seats. President Maduro has admitted defeat, recognising ""these adverse results"". It is the worst-ever defeat for the leftist movement founded by former leader Hugo Chavez in 1999. The Socialists have gained 46 seats, with another 22 yet to be declared. Results arrived much later than expected, five hours after polls closed. Fireworks erupted over the capital, Caracas, soon after. Among the campaign issues were chronic food shortages of staples - such as milk, rice, coffee, sugar, corn flour and cooking oil. Venezuela has been hit hard by the continuing low price of oil, its main export. It also has the continent's highest inflation rate. Mr Maduro has blamed the situation on an ""economic war"" waged by the opposition. ""We have come with our morals and our ethics [intact] to recognize these adverse results, to accept them and to say to our Venezuela that the constitution and democracy have triumphed. ""We have lost a battle today, but the struggle to build a new society is just beginning."" - Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's president and head of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. ""The results are as we hoped. Venezuela has won. It's irreversible,"" tweeted (in Spanish) Henrique Capriles, a leading opposition figure in the Democratic Unity Roundtable and a former presidential challenger. ""Venezuela wanted a change and that change came. A new majority expressed itself and sent a clear and resounding message."" - Jesus Torrealba - opposition coalition chief. The opposition alliance, made up of centrist and conservative parties, is confident of ultimately taking at least 112 seats after 16 years of socialist control. According to senior figures in the alliance, that would allow them to pass laws allowing the release of political prisoners and to reverse, for example, appointments to senior legal positions made by the current government, says the BBC's Wyre Davies, in Caracas. It also gives stronger momentum to the opposition should it wish to call a referendum on Mr Maduro's future. This could take place only when his presidency reaches its halfway point in April next year. However, under Venezuela's presidential system the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) will still be a powerful force, as it controls many municipalities. The next presidential election is due in April 2019. The elections were widely seen as a referendum on President Maduro, the handpicked successor of the late President Hugo Chavez, and the party's socialist policies. The opposition accused the PSUV of mismanaging the economy and of squandering the country's oil wealth. Mr Maduro says his party defends the interests of ordinary Venezuelans and wants to complete Mr Chavez's ""Bolivarian Revolution"". The opposition also accused the government of increasing authoritarianism. Earlier this year, opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was given a 13-year prison sentence for inciting violence - a charge critics say was politically motivated.

"Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has won re-election to another six-year term, in a vote marred by an opposition boycott and claims of vote-rigging. Amid food shortages stemming from a severe economic crisis turnout was low. The National Electoral Council (CNE) put it at just 46% but the opposition alleges it was even lower. The main opposition candidate, Henri Falcón, rejected the result soon after the polls closed and called for new elections.  ""We do not recognise this electoral process as valid... we have to have new elections in Venezuela,"" he said. With more than 90% of the votes counted, Mr Maduro had 67.7% - 5.8 million votes - CNE chief Tibisay Lucena announced. Mr Falcón had won 21.2% - 1.8 million votes - she said. With Venezuela's main opposition coalition boycotting the election, a win by President Maduro had been widely expected. What observers were more interested in was to see how many Venezuelans would turn out to vote. The CNE said turnout would probably rise to 48%, still well below the figure in the 2013 presidential election, when almost 80% of eligible voters cast their ballots. The opposition, however, accused the CNE of inflating its figures and claimed the real number was closer to 30%. A source within the CNE told Reuters that only 32.3% of eligible voters had cast their ballot by 18:00 local time, when most voting stations closed.  Under the Venezuelan constitution, the CNE is the official independent body responsible for overseeing and guaranteeing the transparency of all elections.  It is made up of five members. The opposition alleges that four of the five are government stooges and therefore does not trust the body to be independent. Luis Emilio Rondón, the one CNE member which has been critical of the government, said he did not recognise the results because ""Venezuelans' freedom to vote"" had not been respected.   Mr Maduro and his supporters were jubilant. The 55 year old told cheering crowds outside the presidential palace in Caracas that ""the revolution is here to stay!"". His supporters chanted ""let's go, Nico!"" as fireworks went off and confetti was fired in the air. He also mocked his main rival, Mr Falcón, saying he had been left ""groggy"" by the knockout victory Mr Maduro had achieved.   And while on the one hand he called for dialogue with the opposition, he also told supporters that ""the opposition must leave us alone to govern"". Previous attempts at dialogue between the opposition and the government have failed.  The main opposition coalition had warned that the election would not be free and fair. It said the poll had been brought forward from December 2018 to take advantage of disarray within opposition ranks and that some of the most promising candidates had been banned from standing or jailed, while many others had fled the country.  That is why it called for a boycott. Mr Falcón however broke ranks, arguing Venezuelans should be given a chance to vote Mr Maduro out of office. But following the vote, he too alleged it had been rigged in Mr Maduro's favour, by abuse of the scanning of state-issued benefits cards used for accessing food. He has called for a rerun. By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent, Caracas Such was the expectation that Nicolás Maduro would win that his rivals admitted defeat, denouncing the result before it had even been announced. There was never going to be any result other than a Maduro victory - and Venezuelans knew that.  It feels like most people here are no longer outraged. Disappointed, maybe, but it's par for the course in a country where political freedom feels increasingly limited.  Mr Maduro has promised change in Venezuela - why he needed a second mandate to do that is anyone's guess. He's already been in the job five years. Added to that, change for the better under Mr Maduro is unlikely. With international pressure likely to build after these results, and with a crumbling economy, his job is harder than ever - as are the lives of Venezuelans. As polling started, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced the election as a ""sham"" on Twitter. The US mission to the United Nations called the process an ""insult to democracy"" and Chile and Panama said that they would not recognise the result.   El Salvador and Cuba, on the other hand, congratulated President Maduro on his election win. All eyes are now on the US to see whether it will impose sanctions on Venezuela's all-important oil sector, as it has threatened to do. The European Union and Latin American countries had also warned ahead of the vote that they would take measures against the government if it went ahead with the election. The exodus of Venezuelans leaving their country is expected to speed up further. According to International Office of Migration figures, the number of Venezuelans living abroad increased to an estimated 1.6 million in 2017 from 700,000 in 2015.  They have been driven out by Venezuela's severe economic crisis which has led to shortages of food and medicine and the world's highest inflation rate. Those leaving speak of the struggle to feed their families and growing levels of child malnutrition which have hit 70% in some rural areas. Copyright 2023 BBC.

"By          John Otis       After years of political gridlock, Venezuela's opposition is coming together ahead of next year's general election to try to defeat the country's authoritarian leader.

"Jesus Maria Casal, president of Venezuela's opposition's National Primary Commission, leaves after a meeting with Elvis Hidrobo Amoroso, head of Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE), in Caracas, Venezuela September 25, 2023. REUTERS/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights CARACAS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition election commission said on Monday it will move forward with its late October primary vote to pick its presidential candidate for next year's general election, after the country's national electoral council sought a delay. The South American nation's beleaguered political opposition will face off against President Nicolas Maduro's ruling socialists, who have presided over a prolonged economic meltdown marked by sky-high inflation and persecution of critics, according to rights groups. Maduro is expected to run for re-election, but has not yet made a formal announcement. Last month, the National Electoral Council (CNE) - seen by the opposition as aligned with Maduro - responded to a June request to assist with the opposition's primary, saying it could provide voting centers and machines but stressing more time was needed to help organize the primary vote for later in November. But most of the 13 opposition candidates rejected this request, preferring to keep the Oct. 22 primary, while criticizing what they called a slow CNE response. The opposition commission - made up of eight lawyers and experts - said it had asked for up to 400 additional voting centers as well as security at the centers and help facilitating visas for electoral experts and foreign journalists covering the process. In its own statement later on Monday, the CNE insisted it holds ""exclusive competency"" to organize elections but would provide technical support to the opposition ""to guarantee a reliable, transparent process"" that promotes participation and security. The statement did not address the primary election's date. Venezuela's opposition counts some 3,000 voting centers, according to commission president Jesus Maria Casal. Some 14,000 Venezuelan schools typically serve as electoral centers for the country's 20 million voters, but since the primary is being carried out independently, these cannot be used without CNE authorization. Venezuelan authorities have in recent months disqualified some opposition candidates, including former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado, the opposition's leading hopeful in polls.

"[1/2]Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro speaks during a meeting with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi at the Miraflores Palace, in Caracas, Venezuela June 12, 2023. REUTERS/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights CARACAS/WASHINGTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Venezuela's government and its political opposition on Tuesday agreed to electoral guarantees for 2024 presidential elections, paving the way for possible U.S. sanctions relief, though the deal did not lift bans on opposition candidates barred from public office. The elections will take place in the second half of next year, and international observers - including from the European Union and United Nations - will oversee the vote, according to terms unveiled following a resumption of long-suspended talks. Multiple sources had said ahead of Tuesday's announcement that the U.S. was prepared to ease some oil-related sanctions on OPEC member-nation Venezuela if Washington was satisfied President Nicolas Maduro had given enough ground to the opposition. President Joe Biden's administration had said it would lift some long-standing punitive measures in exchange for democratic concessions from Maduro. But as the White House studied the details of the agreement finalized in Barbados, it was unclear how soon the U.S. might act or how far it could go with sanctions relief. ""We welcome the Venezuelan-led political agreement reached today in Barbados,"" according to a joint statement from the U.S., EU, Britain and Canada, calling it a necessary step toward the ""restoration of democracy in Venezuela."" However, the statement also reiterated calls for release of political prisoners, independence of the electoral process, freedom of expression and respect for human rights, issues that were not covered in Tuesday's agreement. Reuters reported last week that Venezuela and the U.S. had progressed at their own talks in Qatar toward a deal that could allow at least one additional foreign oil firm to take Venezuelan crude oil for debt repayment if Maduro resumed negotiations with the opposition. Any significant alleviation of oil sanctions would mark a further shift by the Biden administration away from former President Donald Trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign against the socialist-led South American country. But U.S. sources have said any U.S. policy changes would be reversible if Maduro failed to meet his election commitments. Oil revenues are crucial to Venezuela's crippled economy. Tuesday's meeting in Barbados, brokered by Norway, was the first between the two sides in 11 months. The talks, meant to provide a way out of Venezuela's long-running political and economic crisis, will continue at an unspecified date, the parties said, adding they are committed to respecting the results of the vote. The deal says each side can choose its 2024 candidate according to its internal rules, but did not reverse bans on some opposition figures - including Oct. 22 primary frontrunner Maria Corina Machado - that prevent them from holding office. The opposition has said the bans, handed down by the controller general, are unlawful and Washington has rejected any roadblocks to opposition candidates. ""If you have an administrative inhabilitation...from the controller general of the republic you cannot be a candidate, I want to clarify that,"" Jorge Rodriguez, the head of the government delegation told a press conference after the signing. Speaking before Rodriguez, the head of the opposition delegation Gerardo Blyde had said the deal could allow banned candidates to ""recover their rights."" The opposition has shied away from laying out what could happen if Machado were to win the primary but could not register for the general election. It remains unclear whether the often-fractious opposition would accept her choosing another candidate to run in her stead. At least two candidates who initially had been set to run in the primary have bowed out because they are banned. Maduro, president since 2013, is expected to run for re-election but has not yet formalized his candidacy. The U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela to punish Maduro's government following a 2018 election that Washington considered a sham. Since 2019, U.S. sanctions have banned PDVSA from exporting its oil to its chosen markets. The other accord signed by the two sides includes an agreement to protect Houston-based oil refiner Citgo Petroleum, whose parent company's shares will be put for auction starting this month through a court-organized process to pay creditors.

"Venezuelan government officials and representatives of the opposition have signed an agreement which lays some of the groundwork for presidential elections that will be recognised by both sides to be held.    The government agreed to invite international observers to monitor the election, which has been scheduled for the second half of 2024. The 2018 election had been widely dismissed as neither free nor fair.  The deal was signed in Barbados. The agreement constitutes a rare breakthrough after a 11-month hiatus during which talks had stalled. But analysts point out that it fails to address many of the issues which the opposition had been pushing to have resolved. There is no mention of a release of political prisoners or the lifting of a ban on a number of opposition candidates vying to run in the 2024 election. In a joint statement, the US, the EU, Canada and the UK welcomed the agreement, which they described as a ""necessary step in the continuation of an inclusive dialogue process and the restoration of democracy in Venezuela"". But in an indication of the work still ahead, the statement also called for ""the unconditional release of all those unjustly detained, the independence of the electoral process and judicial institutions, freedom of expression including for members of the press, and respect for human and political rights"". The agreement signed on Tuesday contains 12 points, which include promises to give all candidates access to public and private media, and to guarantee their free and safe movement throughout the country.   The two sides have also agreed to update the voter registries, both inside and outside of the country, in order to ensure that the millions of Venezuelans who have emigrated can exercise their right to vote. But one point, which concerns the eligibility of candidates to stand for the presidency, already appears to have caused disagreement.  The document says that ""the registration for the presidential election will be open to all candidates who meet the constitutional requirements"". The head of the opposition delegation, Gerardo Blyde, said that it could open the door for opposition candidates who have been barred from holding office to ""recover their rights"". But the leader of the government delegation, Jorge Rodríguez, appeared to contradict him, stating that candidates who had been barred from running by the comptroller-general would not be able to stand in the 2024 election. The issue is particularly contentious because a number of popular opposition figures have had bans slapped on them by the comptroller-general, who is a close ally of President Maduro. Among them is María Corina Machado, who is thought to be the favourite to win Sunday's primary to choose a unified candidate to represent the opposition in the 2024 election. The 56-year-old former lawmaker has refused to drop out of the race, arguing that if she is chosen as the unity opposition candidate on Sunday, the Maduro government will eventually have to bow to pressure to lift the ban on her.  The government has not yet officially announced who will be its candidate but Mr Maduro is widely expected to run for another term. The Maduro government is hoping that Tuesday's deal will lead to an easing of US sanctions, which were ramped up following his 2018 election win, which the US has described as ""illegitimate"".  The US has a vested interest in the crisis in Venezuela easing as the dire state of the economy in the Andean country has driven more than seven million Venezuelans to emigrate, with many heading to the United States. Venezuela also has the world's largest proven oil reserves and a scaling back of US sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry would benefit both countries economically.  Ms Machado plans to challenge Nicolás Maduro in next year's presidential election. Opposition groups aim to pick one figure to take on the government's candidate in the 2024 election. The US relaxes sanctions after an agreement to have international observers monitor the 2024 election. The two sides are reportedly close to signing a deal on conditions under which to hold elections in 2024. Nicolás Maduro was banned from visiting Brazil by the country's former far-right leader.

Acquire Licensing Rights Read more CARACAS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado is leading the vote count in the Venezuelan opposition's presidential primary by a huge margin and has claimed victory in the Sunday contest, with final results pending. The vote to choose a unity opposition candidate to face President Nicolas Maduro in his probable re-election bid next year came amid pledges by the United States to roll back sanctions relief if the government fails to lift bans preventing some opposition figures from holding office. Machado was tallying 93% of the vote, with just over 26% of ballot boxes counted, the primary's organizing commission said around midnight. ""From tonight we begin a great movement for a great national alliance for the transformation of Venezuela,"" Machado said at her campaign headquarters. ""Today I received a mandate and I accept with Venezuelans the commitment of making that mandate matter."" The count - delayed by a server blockage - was expected to resume later on Monday. It was unclear when the next results update would be given. Machado's nearest rival, former lawmaker Carlos Prosperi, had 4.75% of the vote. Participation in the vote, organized without state help, was more than double what had been expected in some states. Venezuela has about 20 million eligible voters. Polling places - including in private homes and on street corners - were meant to close at 4 p.m. (2000 GMT), but many remained opened hours later, so those waiting in long lines could vote or so additional ballots could be delivered. Some of the estimated 3,000 polling locations nationwide had to be moved, according to human rights groups and voters, causing confusion. Voters also faced transportation problems. Gasoline availability was limited in border states Tachira and Bolivar and public transport in the country's interior was working irregularly, according to Reuters witnesses. ""On Friday we waited in three lines to be able to get gasoline for today and we couldn't,"" said housewife Melissa Diaz, 39, who arrived at her polling place in eastern Guyana City with a nearly empty tank. ""We've lost a whole day, but even if we had to walk or cycle, we were coming to vote."" Machado, 56, an industrial engineer, has led her rivals by some 40 points in polls. But Machado, like two former rivals who dropped out of the race, is barred from public office over her support of the sanctions on Maduro's government and would not be able to register for the general election. The opposition and government this week signed a deal on some election guarantees, including the presence of international observers. The accord allows each side to choose its candidate according to internal rules, but did not retract the election disqualifications. The United States, which broadly eased Trump-era sanctions on Venezuelan oil and gas and bonds in response to the deal, has said Maduro has until the end of November to begin rescinding the bans and releasing political prisoners and ""wrongfully detained"" Americans. Though five people were released, lead government negotiator Jorge Rodriguez confirmed this week that those with disqualifications cannot run in the 2024 contest, set for the second half of the year. Some in the opposition have said they are skeptical Maduro will follow through on the deal. The opposition, which says the disqualifications are unlawful, has been reticent to say what it would do if Machado wins the primary but is unable to compete in 2024. Machado - who says her goal is to remove Maduro in a fair and peaceful vote - has said she would pressure the electoral authorities to let her register. Maduro has not announced that he will seek re-election, but many observers expect him to run. Others have argued selecting a substitute candidate would be necessary, although whether the often-fractious opposition would accept Machado choosing a replacement remains to be seen. Ten candidates are competing in the primary, where candidates have pledged to come up with solutions for the country's long economic crisis. ""If you buy diapers you don't buy food, so I buy food and not diapers,"" said 20-year-old hairdresser Rosimar Gonzalez, who voted in central Maracay with her young son in her arms. ""We have to change presidents."" About 4 million of the 7.7 million Venezuelans migrants who have left their country are estimated to be of voting age and are able to vote at centers in 28 countries. ""I came to vote because I want to hug my grandchildren again, because I want to see my country on the road to freedom before I go,"" said a teary Armando Cedeno, 100, who voted in the afternoon in Maracaibo. ""I am confident that God will give me that gift.""

"CARACAS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Venezuela's Supreme Justice Tribunal said on Monday it has suspended the results of an opposition presidential primary that took place this month, despite an electoral deal between the government and the opposition that allows each side to choose its candidate. The ruling could risk the wrath of the United States, which this month rolled back some oil and gas industry and bond trading sanctions in exchange for the electoral deal. The U.S. State Department has already said it will reinstate sanctions if the government of President Nicolas Maduro does not lift bans on some opposition candidates and free political prisoners and ""wrongfully detained"" Americans by the end of November. The decision by the court, which the opposition considers an arm of the government, comes after the attorney general announced last week that his office is investigating the primary and members of its organizing commission for electoral violations, financial crimes and conspiracy. Members of the organizing commission were meeting with prosecutors on Monday for interviews related to the case, the commission said on social media. The opposition and the primary's winner Maria Corina Machado have insisted repeatedly the Oct. 22 vote was transparent and fair. The government has decried alleged fraud since the day of the vote, which was organized without state help and which attracted more than 2.3 million voters. The government of Maduro, in power for a decade, and the opposition signed an electoral deal in Barbados, agreeing to international observers and that each side can choose its candidate according to internal rules. [1/2]Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado speaks during an event to receive the credential as winner of the October 22 opposition's primary election, in Caracas, Venezuela October 26, 2023. REUTERS/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights ""We urge Nicolas Maduro and his representatives to uphold the commitments they made at the signing of the political roadmap agreement,"" a State Department spokesperson said. ""The U.S. government will take action if Maduro and his representatives do not meet their commitments."" Both the investigation and the ruling come at the request of lawmaker Jose Brito, who the court said wanted to participate in the primary. Brito does not belong to any of the parties that took part. ""Following the request of preventative protection and in consequence, all the effects of the distinct phases of the electoral process conducted by the National Primary Commission are suspended,"" the tribunal said on its website. The commission must present all documents related to its creation, candidate registration, voting records and other documents, the tribunal said. The commission must also account for the participation of candidates like Machado, who is barred from holding public office in a decision the opposition says is illegal. The ruling ""temporarily suspends the primary until there is a final decision from the tribunal,"" said lawyer and university professor Jose Vicente Haro. ""The tribunal is late to the decision because it comes after the primary. They shouldn't have accepted the petition."" Some observers said the opposition parties that participated in the primary should simply recognize Machado once again as their unity candidate, making any ruling on the contest moot. The opposition this month declined electoral authorities' offer of help organize the primary, and its request to delay the vote until November, after the authorities took several months to respond to the opposition's request for assistance.
