The BBC's Wyre Davies said it was a ""devastating night"" for the Socialists
The opposition in Venezuela has won a majority of seats in the National Assembly, overturning nearly two decades of dominance by the Socialists of President Nicolas Maduro.
Five hours after polling ended, the National Electoral Council announced the opposition had won 99 seats.
President Maduro has admitted defeat, recognising ""these adverse results"".
It is the worst-ever defeat for the leftist movement founded by former leader Hugo Chavez in 1999.
The Socialists have gained 46 seats, with another 22 yet to be declared.
Results arrived much later than expected, five hours after polls closed. Fireworks erupted over the capital, Caracas, soon after.
Among the campaign issues were chronic food shortages of staples - such as milk, rice, coffee, sugar, corn flour and cooking oil.
Venezuela has been hit hard by the continuing low price of oil, its main export. It also has the continent's highest inflation rate.
Mr Maduro has blamed the situation on an ""economic war"" waged by the opposition.
""We have come with our morals and our ethics [intact] to recognize these adverse results, to accept them and to say to our Venezuela that the constitution and democracy have triumphed.
""We have lost a battle today, but the struggle to build a new society is just beginning."" - Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's president and head of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela.
""The results are as we hoped. Venezuela has won. It's irreversible,"" tweeted (in Spanish) Henrique Capriles, a leading opposition figure in the Democratic Unity Roundtable and a former presidential challenger.
""Venezuela wanted a change and that change came. A new majority expressed itself and sent a clear and resounding message."" - Jesus Torrealba - opposition coalition chief.
The opposition alliance, made up of centrist and conservative parties, is confident of ultimately taking at least 112 seats after 16 years of socialist control.
According to senior figures in the alliance, that would allow them to pass laws allowing the release of political prisoners and to reverse, for example, appointments to senior legal positions made by the current government, says the BBC's Wyre Davies, in Caracas.
It also gives stronger momentum to the opposition should it wish to call a referendum on Mr Maduro's future. This could take place only when his presidency reaches its halfway point in April next year.
However, under Venezuela's presidential system the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) will still be a powerful force, as it controls many municipalities.
The next presidential election is due in April 2019.
The elections were widely seen as a referendum on President Maduro, the handpicked successor of the late President Hugo Chavez, and the party's socialist policies.
The opposition accused the PSUV of mismanaging the economy and of squandering the country's oil wealth.
Mr Maduro says his party defends the interests of ordinary Venezuelans and wants to complete Mr Chavez's ""Bolivarian Revolution"".
The opposition also accused the government of increasing authoritarianism.
Earlier this year, opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was given a 13-year prison sentence for inciting violence - a charge critics say was politically motivated.

20992,60212,"Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has won re-election to another six-year term, in a vote marred by an opposition boycott and claims of vote-rigging.
Amid food shortages stemming from a severe economic crisis turnout was low.
The National Electoral Council (CNE) put it at just 46% but the opposition alleges it was even lower.
The main opposition candidate, Henri Falcón, rejected the result soon after the polls closed and called for new elections. 
""We do not recognise this electoral process as valid... we have to have new elections in Venezuela,"" he said.
With more than 90% of the votes counted, Mr Maduro had 67.7% - 5.8 million votes - CNE chief Tibisay Lucena announced. Mr Falcón had won 21.2% - 1.8 million votes - she said.
With Venezuela's main opposition coalition boycotting the election, a win by President Maduro had been widely expected. What observers were more interested in was to see how many Venezuelans would turn out to vote.
The CNE said turnout would probably rise to 48%, still well below the figure in the 2013 presidential election, when almost 80% of eligible voters cast their ballots.
The opposition, however, accused the CNE of inflating its figures and claimed the real number was closer to 30%. A source within the CNE told Reuters that only 32.3% of eligible voters had cast their ballot by 18:00 local time, when most voting stations closed. 
Under the Venezuelan constitution, the CNE is the official independent body responsible for overseeing and guaranteeing the transparency of all elections. 
It is made up of five members. The opposition alleges that four of the five are government stooges and therefore does not trust the body to be independent.
Luis Emilio Rondón, the one CNE member which has been critical of the government, said he did not recognise the results because ""Venezuelans' freedom to vote"" had not been respected.  
Mr Maduro and his supporters were jubilant. The 55 year old told cheering crowds outside the presidential palace in Caracas that ""the revolution is here to stay!"".
His supporters chanted ""let's go, Nico!"" as fireworks went off and confetti was fired in the air.
He also mocked his main rival, Mr Falcón, saying he had been left ""groggy"" by the knockout victory Mr Maduro had achieved.  
And while on the one hand he called for dialogue with the opposition, he also told supporters that ""the opposition must leave us alone to govern"".
Previous attempts at dialogue between the opposition and the government have failed. 
The main opposition coalition had warned that the election would not be free and fair.
It said the poll had been brought forward from December 2018 to take advantage of disarray within opposition ranks and that some of the most promising candidates had been banned from standing or jailed, while many others had fled the country. 
That is why it called for a boycott. Mr Falcón however broke ranks, arguing Venezuelans should be given a chance to vote Mr Maduro out of office.
But following the vote, he too alleged it had been rigged in Mr Maduro's favour, by abuse of the scanning of state-issued benefits cards used for accessing food. He has called for a rerun.
By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent, Caracas
Such was the expectation that Nicolás Maduro would win that his rivals admitted defeat, denouncing the result before it had even been announced. There was never going to be any result other than a Maduro victory - and Venezuelans knew that. 
It feels like most people here are no longer outraged. Disappointed, maybe, but it's par for the course in a country where political freedom feels increasingly limited. 
Mr Maduro has promised change in Venezuela - why he needed a second mandate to do that is anyone's guess. He's already been in the job five years. Added to that, change for the better under Mr Maduro is unlikely. With international pressure likely to build after these results, and with a crumbling economy, his job is harder than ever - as are the lives of Venezuelans.
As polling started, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced the election as a ""sham"" on Twitter.
The US mission to the United Nations called the process an ""insult to democracy"" and Chile and Panama said that they would not recognise the result.  
El Salvador and Cuba, on the other hand, congratulated President Maduro on his election win.
All eyes are now on the US to see whether it will impose sanctions on Venezuela's all-important oil sector, as it has threatened to do.
The European Union and Latin American countries had also warned ahead of the vote that they would take measures against the government if it went ahead with the election.
The exodus of Venezuelans leaving their country is expected to speed up further. According to International Office of Migration figures, the number of Venezuelans living abroad increased to an estimated 1.6 million in 2017 from 700,000 in 2015. 
They have been driven out by Venezuela's severe economic crisis which has led to shortages of food and medicine and the world's highest inflation rate.
Those leaving speak of the struggle to feed their families and growing levels of child malnutrition which have hit 70% in some rural areas.

CARACAS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition election commission said on Monday it will move forward with its late October primary vote to pick its presidential candidate for next year's general election, after the country's national electoral council sought a delay.
The South American nation's beleaguered political opposition will face off against President Nicolas Maduro's ruling socialists, who have presided over a prolonged economic meltdown marked by sky-high inflation and persecution of critics, according to rights groups.
Maduro is expected to run for re-election, but has not yet made a formal announcement.
Last month, the National Electoral Council (CNE) - seen by the opposition as aligned with Maduro - responded to a June request to assist with the opposition's primary, saying it could provide voting centers and machines but stressing more time was needed to help organize the primary vote for later in November.
But most of the 13 opposition candidates rejected this request, preferring to keep the Oct. 22 primary, while criticizing what they called a slow CNE response.
The opposition commission - made up of eight lawyers and experts - said it had asked for up to 400 additional voting centers as well as security at the centers and help facilitating visas for electoral experts and foreign journalists covering the process.
In its own statement later on Monday, the CNE insisted it holds ""exclusive competency"" to organize elections but would provide technical support to the opposition ""to guarantee a reliable, transparent process"" that promotes participation and security.
The statement did not address the primary election's date.
Venezuela's opposition counts some 3,000 voting centers, according to commission president Jesus Maria Casal.
Some 14,000 Venezuelan schools typically serve as electoral centers for the country's 20 million voters, but since the primary is being carried out independently, these cannot be used without CNE authorization.
Venezuelan authorities have in recent months disqualified some opposition candidates, including former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado, the opposition's leading hopeful in polls.

CARACAS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado is leading the vote count in the Venezuelan opposition's presidential primary by a huge margin and has claimed victory in the Sunday contest, with final results pending.
The vote to choose a unity opposition candidate to face President Nicolas Maduro in his probable re-election bid next year came amid pledges by the United States to roll back sanctions relief if the government fails to lift bans preventing some opposition figures from holding office.
Machado was tallying 93% of the vote, with just over 26% of ballot boxes counted, the primary's organizing commission said around midnight.
""From tonight we begin a great movement for a great national alliance for the transformation of Venezuela,"" Machado said at her campaign headquarters.
""Today I received a mandate and I accept with Venezuelans the commitment of making that mandate matter.""
The count - delayed by a server blockage - was expected to resume later on Monday. It was unclear when the next results update would be given.
Machado's nearest rival, former lawmaker Carlos Prosperi, had 4.75% of the vote.
Participation in the vote, organized without state help, was more than double what had been expected in some states. Venezuela has about 20 million eligible voters.
Polling places - including in private homes and on street corners - were meant to close at 4 p.m. (2000 GMT), but many remained opened hours later, so those waiting in long lines could vote or so additional ballots could be delivered.
Some of the estimated 3,000 polling locations nationwide had to be moved, according to human rights groups and voters, causing confusion.
Voters also faced transportation problems. Gasoline availability was limited in border states Tachira and Bolivar and public transport in the country's interior was working irregularly, according to Reuters witnesses.
""On Friday we waited in three lines to be able to get gasoline for today and we couldn't,"" said housewife Melissa Diaz, 39, who arrived at her polling place in eastern Guyana City with a nearly empty tank.
""We've lost a whole day, but even if we had to walk or cycle, we were coming to vote.""
Machado, 56, an industrial engineer, has led her rivals by some 40 points in polls.
But Machado, like two former rivals who dropped out of the race, is barred from public office over her support of the sanctions on Maduro's government and would not be able to register for the general election.
The opposition and government this week signed a deal on some election guarantees, including the presence of international observers. The accord allows each side to choose its candidate according to internal rules, but did not retract the election disqualifications.
The United States, which broadly eased Trump-era sanctions on Venezuelan oil and gas and bonds in response to the deal, has said Maduro has until the end of November to begin rescinding the bans and releasing political prisoners and ""wrongfully detained"" Americans.
Though five people were released, lead government negotiator Jorge Rodriguez confirmed this week that those with disqualifications cannot run in the 2024 contest, set for the second half of the year.
Some in the opposition have said they are skeptical Maduro will follow through on the deal.
The opposition, which says the disqualifications are unlawful, has been reticent to say what it would do if Machado wins the primary but is unable to compete in 2024.
Machado - who says her goal is to remove Maduro in a fair and peaceful vote - has said she would pressure the electoral authorities to let her register. Maduro has not announced that he will seek re-election, but many observers expect him to run.
Others have argued selecting a substitute candidate would be necessary, although whether the often-fractious opposition would accept Machado choosing a replacement remains to be seen.
Ten candidates are competing in the primary, where candidates have pledged to come up with solutions for the country's long economic crisis.
""If you buy diapers you don't buy food, so I buy food and not diapers,"" said 20-year-old hairdresser Rosimar Gonzalez, who voted in central Maracay with her young son in her arms.
""We have to change presidents.""
About 4 million of the 7.7 million Venezuelans migrants who have left their country are estimated to be of voting age and are able to vote at centers in 28 countries.
""I came to vote because I want to hug my grandchildren again, because I want to see my country on the road to freedom before I go,"" said a teary Armando Cedeno, 100, who voted in the afternoon in Maracaibo.
""I am confident that God will give me that gift.""
(This story has been corrected to say the vote count will resume on Monday in paragraph 6)

20992,20704,"CARACAS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Venezuela's Supreme Justice Tribunal said on Monday it has suspended the results of an opposition presidential primary that took place this month, despite an electoral deal between the government and the opposition that allows each side to choose its candidate.
The ruling could risk the wrath of the United States, which this month rolled back some oil and gas industry and bond trading sanctions in exchange for the electoral deal.
The U.S. State Department has already said it will reinstate sanctions if the government of President Nicolas Maduro does not lift bans on some opposition candidates and free political prisoners and ""wrongfully detained"" Americans by the end of November.
The decision by the court, which the opposition considers an arm of the government, comes after the attorney general announced last week that his office is investigating the primary and members of its organizing commission for electoral violations, financial crimes and conspiracy.
Members of the organizing commission were meeting with prosecutors on Monday for interviews related to the case, the commission said on social media.
The opposition and the primary's winner Maria Corina Machado have insisted repeatedly the Oct. 22 vote was transparent and fair.
The government has decried alleged fraud since the day of the vote, which was organized without state help and which attracted more than 2.3 million voters.
The government of Maduro, in power for a decade, and the opposition signed an electoral deal in Barbados, agreeing to international observers and that each side can choose its candidate according to internal rules.

""We urge Nicolas Maduro and his representatives to uphold the commitments they made at the signing of the political roadmap agreement,"" a State Department spokesperson said. ""The U.S. government will take action if Maduro and his representatives do not meet their commitments.""
Both the investigation and the ruling come at the request of lawmaker Jose Brito, who the court said wanted to participate in the primary.
Brito does not belong to any of the parties that took part.
""Following the request of preventative protection and in consequence, all the effects of the distinct phases of the electoral process conducted by the National Primary Commission are suspended,"" the tribunal said on its website.
The commission must present all documents related to its creation, candidate registration, voting records and other documents, the tribunal said.
The commission must also account for the participation of candidates like Machado, who is barred from holding public office in a decision the opposition says is illegal.
The ruling ""temporarily suspends the primary until there is a final decision from the tribunal,"" said lawyer and university professor Jose Vicente Haro. ""The tribunal is late to the decision because it comes after the primary. They shouldn't have accepted the petition.""
Some observers said the opposition parties that participated in the primary should simply recognize Machado once again as their unity candidate, making any ruling on the contest moot.
The opposition this month declined electoral authorities' offer of help organize the primary, and its request to delay the vote until November, after the authorities took several months to respond to the opposition's request for assistance.

Editor's note: This story was first published on Feb. 9, 2021. It is regularly updated, and includes explicit language.
On Jan. 6, 2021, supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol, injuring scores of law enforcement officers, forcing a panicked evacuation of the nation's political leaders, and threatening the peaceful transfer of power.
Five people died during or soon after the riot, and more than $2.9 million worth of damage was done to the Capitol and grounds. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has estimated that 2,000 people may have been involved that day, and considers the attack an act of domestic terrorism. In response, the Department of Justice launched the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history.
NPR is tracking every criminal case stemming from that day's events. This database makes publicly available — and searchable — information on hundreds of cases, including alleged affiliation with extremist ideologies and past or present police or military experience.

Was it an insurrection? A coup? Should we call it domestic terrorism? Or just a peaceful protest gone awry? As a battle of politics becomes a battle for words to describe what happened in the capital and on Capitol Hill on January 6, 2021, Christopher Booker speaks to Joanne Freeman, a history professor at Yale University about why words used to describe the event today will shape its history.
Hari Sreenivasan:
There have been many discussions this week over the language used to describe the events in the capital and at the Capitol building this week.
NewsHour Weekend's Christopher Booker has more.
Christopher Booker:
Its hard to find the words to describe what happened on Wednesday.
Was it a riot? Was it an insurrection? It certainly was much more than a protest.
It's often said journalism is the first rough draft of history… But what impact will the words we are using have on the way America remembers what happened in Washington this week?
Joanne Freeman:
Even just to describe the attack on the Capitol, know are they rioters or was it a mob? Is it terrorism? Is it insurrection? Is it a coup?
Christopher Booker:
Joanne Freeman is a professor of history at Yale University who specializes in the politics and political culture of the revolutionary and early national periods of American history. She has written extensively about turmoil in American politics.
Joanne Freeman:
One of the striking things about words right now is that in many ways, I think Americans don't quite have the words to describe what's going on.
This morning, I saw some people referring to what happened on Wednesday as the storming of the Capitol. And I actually object to that because storming romanticizes it, there's nothing romantic about what happened. It's not just born of passions, noble passions. It was an act with implications and repercussions. It was an attack on the government. Some people with violence in mind, it was an attack on a symbol of government that has a deep impact and above and beyond the fact that it forced members of Congress to flee in all of these ways. It's not just a peaceful expression of passion.
Christopher Booker:
Yet 'passion' is a word often used.
Ted Cruz:
We gather together at a moment of division, at a moment of great passion.
Christopher Booker:
Senator Ted Cruz reaching for it on the Senate floor as he lodged objections to the state vote certifications on Wednesday.
Joanne Freeman:
Speaking as a historian who's always interested in the meaning of words in the past, in the right context, we're in one of those moments that 50 years from now, historians will look at us grappling to find the right language to talk about this moment.
Now, the other thing about language in this moment, you know, fascism, socialism, communism, even democracy, liberty, freedom, patriotism.
Donald Trump:
Looking out at all the amazing patriots here today, I have never been more confident in our nation's future.
Joanne Freeman We're in a battle of words as well as a battle of politics, particularly  when you have extreme circumstances like we're experiencing right now, those kinds of words can be used as masks to mask extremism: This is democracy! This is liberty, this is freedom!
Now, here's the thing, and it's going to sound obvious, but I think it's important to realize in a democratic form of government, a democracy is grounded on public sentiment and public opinion. That's really basically where the power is. A pronouncement made from on high, meaning the national stage, a congressman, a president. Those words have added meaning and those words can be taken and are almost always taken seriously by some of the public.
Christopher Booker:
It's interesting because they the words and the way the words are being used are also being used, I assume, to recruit more among the far-right. For instance, I'm thinking of tweets that we saw Instagram postings of revolutionaries inside the capital, patriots taking back the people's house.
Joanne Freeman:
Right. Revolutionaries, people are grabbing at moments in the past out of context and using them to frame what they're doing right. This is supremely American. Our revolutionaries did it. We are just like them. That's what we're doing.
And on the surface, you can happily sort of nod along with that. If you actually look at the reality of what happened during the revolution, what happened now and what these people are doing, no, that's not an easy comparison to make and the problem with that and this is the problem of propaganda.
How do you, how do you disprove that? Right. How do you I can say people who attack the Capitol aren't patriots. That's unpatriotic. How what do I say? If someone says, no, I feel very patriotic, I'm defending government as I see it, that's a hard these words are powerful for a reason because they're hard to refute. They're fuzzy and they have a gut impact and a profound political meaning.
Now that leads to another point, which is, there has to be accountability in a broad way right now, because if there isn't, the message is clearly, well, that was fine, that was OK. And why if you were someone who engaged in that kind of behavior and there's no impact of any kind and there's no consequences, why would you not do that again?

		Protesters swarmed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday as Congress met to formally ratify Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election.
		Jack Gruber, USA TODAY

This story was updated Feb. 8. A previous version originally published Jan. 6.
Former President Donald Trump faces his second impeachment trial in the Senate, charged with inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The House of Representatives impeached Trump on the charges last month and oral arguments in the trial are scheduled to begin Tuesday.. Though the article includes events beyond Jan. 6 – including Trump pressuring Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the election results in a recorded phone call — Trump's attorneys argue that he did not incite the crowd the day of the attack, noting that law enforcement says it was planned ahead of time.
The events of Jan. 6 shocked a nation watching it unfold on Twitter and TV. A pro-Trump mob battled police, broke into the U.S. Capitol, and sent members of Congress fleeing as lawmakers were counting Electoral College votes to confirm the presidential victory of Democrat Joe Biden. Now, five people are dead, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer.
Many of the rioters came directly from President Donald Trump’s “Save America Rally” that began hours earlier on the Ellipse, a park near the White House. Trump spoke to them for more than an hour, insisting that the election had been stolen.
“Our country has had enough,” Trump said. “We will not take it anymore, and that’s what this is all about. To use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with, we will stop the steal.” When he was finished, supporters headed for the Capitol building.
Here is how events unfolded. Times are estimates.
Crowds of Trump supporters, estimated in the thousands, prepare for a pro-Trump rally near the Ellipse. Many began gathering the night before. Trump tweeted about the rally on Dec. 19: ""Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!""
Trump’s “Save America Rally” begins first with the president's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., then his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Trump starts speaking at about 11:50 a.m. and speaks for more than an hour.
Trump tells the crowd to head to the Capitol and that “you’ll never take back our country with weakness.” 
Lawmakers gather for a joint session in the House of Representatives chamber to count Electoral College votes.
Around the end of his speech, Trump returns to the idea of fighting for the country and urged those assembled to walk to the Capitol.
“We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,” Trump said. “So we are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue – I love Pennsylvania Avenue – and we are going to the Capitol.”
Rioters begin grappling with police on the Capitol steps.
Capitol police order evacuation of Library of Congress, Madison Building and Cannon House Office Building on Independence Avenue across from the Capitol.
D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser orders citywide curfew starting at 6 p.m. Wednesday and ending at 6 a.m. Thursday. CNN reports District police are asking for more law enforcement.
Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., tweets she is being evacuated after reports of a pipe bomb outside. “Supporters of the President are trying to force their way into the Capitol and I can hear what sounds like multiple gunshots.""
Rioters breach police lines on the west side of the Capitol.
Moments later, rioters scale the walls.
Reports say Vice President Mike Pence has been escorted out of the Senate chamber.
Trump tweets, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!”
C-SPAN reports rioters have crossed Statuary Hall, the chamber that separates the House and Senate, heading for the House and Senate.
Trump tweets, ""Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!""
Rioters are photographed breaking Capitol windows.
Shots are reported fired in the House chamber.
Huffington Post reporter tweets image of rioters at dais. “They’re in the chamber.”
Rep. Alex Mooney, R-W.Va., tweets he has been safely moved from the House chamber. He says he and others were given an escape hood, a respiratory hood and mask for protection in fires or chemical accidents.
Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tennessee, texts “shots fired.”
Rioters are photographed on the Senate floor.
Trump tweets: “I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order – respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!”
CBS reports a woman is in critical condition after being shot in the neck inside the Capitol. Police later report the woman died. She was identified as Ashli Babbitt, 35, an Air Force veteran. Her husband was quoted as saying she was a strong supporter of Trump.
In an account to WUSA9, a purported witness explains what happened, saying they had stormed the building and she was climbing through the window. He says armed police and Secret Service repeatedly warned to get back, but ""she didn't heed the call,"" and then they shot her.
The District of Columbia National Guard, about 1,100 troops, is mobilized to support local law enforcement.
A congressional correspondent tweets that congressional leaders are being evacuated from the Capitol.
In a tweeted video lasting just over a minute, Trump says, in part: “I know your pain. I know you’re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. ...  So go home. We love you, you’re very special. ... I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace.”
Some of Trump's tweets addressing the riot were deleted. Twitter bans the president from tweeting for 12 hours. Twitter first froze the tweets and wouldn't allow comments or retweets, then the ban was imposed.
Congress reconvenes to resume counting Electoral College votes.
D.C. Police Chief Robert Contee said that, in addition to the woman shot by Capitol police, two men and one woman died in “separate medical emergencies.” At least 14 of Contee's officers were injured during the demonstrations, he said. Two pipe bombs were recovered, one at the Democratic National Committee and the other one at the Republican National Committee.
Police identified the woman shot and killed during the riot as Ashli Babbitt, 35, of San Diego, who was a military veteran.
""As protesters were forcing their way toward the House Chamber where Members of Congress were sheltering in place, a sworn (U.S. Capitol Police) employee discharged their service weapon, striking an adult female,"" police said in a statement Thursday.
A U.S. Capitol Police officer died Thursday after being injured when supporters of President Donald Trump raided the Capitol building on Wednesday, bringing the total number of fatalities to five.
Brian D. Sicknick ""was injured while physically engaging with protesters"" on Wednesday, USCP said in a statement. He returned to his division office and collapsed, then was taken to a local hospital where he died Thursday evening. 
""The death of Officer Sicknick will be investigated by the Metropolitan Police Department’s Homicide Branch, the USCP, and our federal partners,"" the USCP said in a statement. 
The other three who perished that day were Benjamin Phillips, 50, from Ringtown, Pennsylvania; Kevin Greeson, 55, from Athens, Alabama; and Rosanne Boyland, 34, from Kennesaw, Georgia. Contee said Thursday all three died on Capitol grounds, but he didn't specify how.

Howard Charles Liebengood, a US Capitol Police officer, died while off-duty on Saturday, according to a statement released Sunday by the Capitol Police and the White House. The department did not disclose the cause of the officer's death, but The Washington Post and other news sources citing a family spokesperson said he died by suicide.
Police made at least 68 arrests, 41 of of them on Capitol grounds, Contee said. Only one of those detained was from D.C., he said.

46196,85735,"Former US President Donald Trump has been charged with plotting to overturn his 2020 election defeat.
He is accused of four counts including conspiracy to defraud the US, tampering with a witness and conspiracy against the rights of citizens.
The indictment caps an inquiry into events which led up to the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol - when supporters of Mr Trump stormed Congress in a bid to thwart the certification of Joe Biden's election victory.
Mr Trump, who is again running for president, denies wrongdoing.
Here are the key moments from 6 January 2021.
President Donald Trump tweets allegations of vote fraud ahead of his rally in Washington DC. 
Members of the Proud Boy movement, a right-wing militia, are seen heading towards the Capitol. Speaking to Newsnight's US correspondent David Grossman, one member of the group says: ""We're taking our country back."" 
One of the group has a radio. ""It was clear he was communicating - getting messages, sending messages to somebody,"" our correspondent said. 
President Trump begins his speech to supporters in Washington. Some 15 minutes into it, he starts urging them to converge on the Capitol. 
""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard,"" he said. 
As the president speaks, a crowd outside the Capitol is swelling. They begin marching towards the police barrier and get past officers. The police, outnumbered, try to contain them. 
Trump supporters wield flags and weapons. One man stands on a makeshift gallows, complete with a noose. The crowd chants: ""Fight for Trump."" 
Minutes later, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi commences the certification process. 
Mr Trump ends his speech with the words: ""We fight. We fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.""
Shortly afterwards a Capitol police officer calls for backup. 
""They're throwing metal poles at us,"" he says. ""Multiple law-enforcement injuries,"" he adds in a panicked voice. 
Capitol police send an evacuation warning. 
Protesters surge past Capitol police protecting the west steps, the side facing the White House. 
Minutes later, an officer declares there is a riot at the Capitol.  ""We're going to give riot warnings,"" he says. ""We're going to try to get compliance but this is now effectively a riot.""
Meanwhile Vice President Mike Pence is continuing to preside over the session. 
Secret Service quickly and suddenly evacuate Mr Pence from the Senate floor. 
The protesters break through the windows. They push inside, hopping through the broken glass. They then kick open the doors to let others in. Some wear hoods and helmets, some hold cameras or Confederate flags.
An immediate recess of the Senate is called. 
A minute later, Officer Eugene Goodman runs to respond to the initial breach. He warns Senator Mitt Romney that the mob is approaching. Mr Romney turns and runs through a capitol hallway to safety. 
The mob, a floor below them, has already begun to search for the Senate chamber. 
Officer Goodman makes his way down to the first floor where he encounters the mob. 
He lures the armed rioters away from the upper chamber. Many of these individuals have been calling for Mr Pence to be hanged.
By that point, the rioters are ""within 100ft"" (30m) of Mr Pence and a foot away from one of the doors to the chamber. Many senators are still inside. 
At the same time, Ms Pelosi is rushed from the house floor. She is evacuated entirely from the Capitol complex to a secure off-site location. 
Her staff barricade themselves into a conference room, hiding under a table. 
Staff members of the House leader speak softly, frantically, to each other. Just outside, rioters are spreading out across the building, searching for Ms Pelosi herself.
The rioters chant: ""Where are you Nancy?"" In an audio clip, we hear one staff member whisper: ""They're pounding on doors trying to find her.""
One man breaks open the outer door to the office where the staff are hiding, but not the inner door. Another tries as well, but eventually moves on.
President Trump tweets about Mr Pence. 
At the same time, Mr Pence is evacuated to a secure location. 
Rioters start to spread through the buildings. Others break in from outside through various doors around the building. 
They open the east side door of the rotunda to let more people in, flooding through the doors and overwhelming the officers. 
The House floor debate is suspended to update members. House members are told to reach for tear gas masks and be prepared to use them. 
The House is called back into session in the hope of continuing the count. 
But minutes later the House is abruptly recessed. Members are told to get down under their chairs if necessary. 
""Folks have entered the rotunda and are coming this way,"" lawmakers are told. 
Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell sends a text to his wife: ""I love you and the babies. Please hug them for me"". 
The mob outside the chamber grows larger and they get within feet of the house door. 
President Trump called Senator Mike Lee, according to the Utah Republican who has provided the trial lawyers with a copy of a log from his mobile phone.
According to his office, he received a call from the White House switchboard number - and the call lasted four minutes. Mr Lee has said that apparently the call was meant for Alabama senator Tommy Tuberville, and that he handed his phone to his colleague.
Mr Tuberville told reporters that he informed Mr Trump that Mr Pence had been evacuated from the Senate floor. ""I said: Mr President, they've taken the vice-president out. They want me to get off the phone, I gotta go.""
House impeachment managers say it is further evidence that the president knew how much danger his vice-president was in.
Ashli Babbit is seen turning the corner towards the House lobby doors as members are leaving.
House Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern is spotted by the mob as he leaves the House floor. 
In a hallway outside the House chamber, a group attempts to force its way through a set of locked doors. The glass window panes on the doors are shattered. A rioter uses a baton to smash through as the crowd around him chants ""break it down, break it down"".
Footage shows the hands of an officer on the other side, holding a gun and pointing it toward the mob. We hear a shot and see Babbitt fall to the ground. 
People still inside the gallery of the chamber are trapped. They tell each other to take off their congressional pins. 
In the meantime, a number of rioters reach the inside of the Senate gallery. 
""Is this the Senate?"" one demands to know. ""Where are they?"" another asks, apparently referring to the evacuated senators.
Video footage shows some rioters rifling through papers and materials left behind by lawmakers. ""There's got to be something we can use against these scumbags,"" one says.
Trump tweets asking for people to ""remain peaceful"". 
Meanwhile the mob are still at the Capitol. 
Footage shows a sprawling mob, a sea of people on the Capitol grounds. A Confederate flag waves in the foreground.
Trump releases a video in which he tells the mob to go home. 
Fifteen minutes after police confirm Ashli Babbitt has died, Trump tweets again. 
He refers to those at the Capitol as ""great patriots"". 
The move comes after eight service members died in a crash off the coast of Japan last week.
Security aid is in jeopardy as US Republicans insist on new US-Mexico border security measures.
British American Tobacco said it could no longer value the business as if it had an infinite life.
The soldiers are accused of torturing a US citizen in Ukraine shortly after Russia's invasion.
The former Republican Speaker of the US House of Representatives will retire at the end of the year.

Then-President Donald Trump speaks to supporters from the Ellipse, near the White House, on Jan. 6 ahead of that day's insurrection at the Capitol. His comments are a key part of the impeachment trial against him.
Former President Donald Trump's remarks on the Ellipse on Jan. 6, urging his supporters to march on the Capitol as Congress was certifying the results of November's presidential election, are a key part of the case against Trump being made by House impeachment managers and are also being used by the lawyers who are defending him.
The House managers in Trump's Senate impeachment trial have already shown clips from the speech, in which Trump outlined a long list of grievances against the news media and against Republicans he deemed were insufficiently supportive, as well as a litany of false claims about how the election had been stolen from him.
Democrats have pointed to one phrase in particular as they argue that Trump incited those present to march down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol. 
""We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,"" he said.
His defense lawyers, however, point to a different passage, in which Trump said, ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard."" They argue that his words were not a call for actual violence and lawlessness. 
Read Trump's remarks in full below, as published by The Associated Press. Editor's note: The video contains profanity.
Well, thank you very much. This is incredible.
Media will not show the magnitude of this crowd. Even I, when I turned on today, I looked, and I saw thousands of people here. But you don't see hundreds of thousands of people behind you because they don't want to show that.
We have hundreds of thousands of people here and I just want them to be recognized by the fake news media. Turn your cameras please and show what's really happening out here because these people are not going to take it any longer. They're not going to take it any longer. Go ahead. Turn your cameras, please. Would you show? They came from all over the world, actually, but they came from all over our country.
I just really want to see what they do. I just want to see how they covered. I've never seen anything like it. But it would be really great if we could be covered fairly by the media. The media is the biggest problem we have as far as I'm concerned, single biggest problem. The fake news and the Big tech.
Big tech is now coming into their own. We beat them four years ago. We surprised them. We took them by surprise and this year they rigged an election. They rigged it like they've never rigged an election before. And by the way, last night they didn't do a bad job either if you notice.
I'm honest. And I just, again, I want to thank you. It's just a great honor to have this kind of crowd and to be before you and hundreds of thousands of American patriots who are committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity of our glorious republic.
All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats, which is what they're doing. And stolen by the fake news media. That's what they've done and what they're doing. We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved.
Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore and that's what this is all about. And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with: We will stop the steal. Today I will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election and we won it by a landslide. This was not a close election.
You know, I say, sometimes jokingly, but there's no joke about it: I've been in two elections. I won them both and the second one, I won much bigger than the first. OK. Almost 75 million people voted for our campaign, the most of any incumbent president by far in the history of our country, 12 million more people than four years ago.
And I was told by the real pollsters — we do have real pollsters — they know that we were going to do well and we were going to win. What I was told, if I went from 63 million, which we had four years ago, to 66 million, there was no chance of losing. Well, we didn't go to 66, we went to 75 million, and they say we lost. We didn't lose.
And by the way, does anybody believe that Joe had 80 million votes? Does anybody believe that? He had 80 million computer votes. It's a disgrace. There's never been anything like that. You could take third-world countries. Just take a look. Take third-world countries. Their elections are more honest than what we've been going through in this country. It's a disgrace. It's a disgrace.
Even when you look at last night. They're all running around like chickens with their heads cut off with boxes. Nobody knows what the hell is going on. There's never been anything like this.
We will not let them silence your voices. We're not going to let it happen, I'm not going to let it happen.
(Audience chants: ""Fight for Trump."")
Thank you.
And I'd love to have if those tens of thousands of people would be allowed. The military, the secret service. And we want to thank you and the police law enforcement. Great. You're doing a great job. But I'd love it if they could be allowed to come up here with us. Is that possible? Can you just let him come up, please?
And Rudy, you did a great job. He's got guts. You know what? He's got guts, unlike a lot of people in the Republican Party. He's got guts. He fights, he fights.
And I'll tell you. Thank you very much, John. Fantastic job. I watched. That's a tough act to follow, those two. John is one of the most brilliant lawyers in the country, and he looked at this and he said, ""What an absolute disgrace that this can be happening to our Constitution.""
And he looked at Mike Pence, and I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. I hope so.
Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election. All he has to do, all this is, this is from the number one, or certainly one of the top, Constitutional lawyers in our country. He has the absolute right to do it. We're supposed to protect our country, support our country, support our Constitution, and protect our constitution.
States want to revote. The states got defrauded. They were given false information. They voted on it. Now they want to recertify. They want it back. All Vice President Pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify and we become president and you are the happiest people.
And I actually, I just spoke to Mike. I said: ""Mike, that doesn't take courage. What takes courage is to do nothing. That takes courage."" And then we're stuck with a president who lost the election by a lot and we have to live with that for four more years. We're just not going to let that happen.
Many of you have traveled from all across the nation to be here, and I want to thank you for the extraordinary love. That's what it is. There's never been a movement like this, ever, ever. For the extraordinary love for this amazing country, and this amazing movement, thank you.
(Audience chants: ""We love Trump."")
By the way, this goes all the way back past the Washington Monument. You believe this? Look at this. That is. Unfortunately gave, they gave the press the prime seats. I can't stand that.
No. But you look at that behind. I wish they'd flip those cameras and look behind you. That is the most amazing sight. When they make a mistake, you get to see it on television. Amazing. Amazing. All the way back.
And don't worry, we will not take the name off the Washington Monument. We will not cancel culture.
You know they wanted to get rid of the Jefferson Memorial. Either take it down or just put somebody else in there. I don't think that's going to happen. It damn well better not. Although, with this administration, if this happens, it could happen. You'll see some really bad things happen.
They'll knock out Lincoln too, by the way. They've been taking his statue down. But then we signed a little law. You hurt our monuments, you hurt our heroes, you go to jail for 10 years, and everything stopped. You notice that? It stopped. It all stopped.
And they could use Rudy back in New York City. Rudy. They could use you. Your city's going to hell. They want Rudy Giuliani back in New York. We'll get a little younger version of Rudy. Is that OK, Rudy?
We're gathered together in the heart of our nation's capital for one very, very basic and simple reason: To save our democracy.
You know most candidates on election evening and, of course, this thing goes on so long. They still don't have any idea what the votes are. We still have congressional seats under review. They have no idea. They've totally lost control. They've used the pandemic as a way of defrauding the people in a proper election.
But you know, you know, when you see this and when you see what's happening. Number one, they all say, ""Sir, we'll never let it happen again."" I said, ""That's good. But what about eight weeks ago?"" You know they try and get you to go.
They said, ""Sir, in four years, you're guaranteed."" I said: ""I'm not interested right now. Do me a favor, go back eight weeks. I want to go back eight weeks. Let's go back eight weeks.""
We want to go back and we want to get this right because we're going to have somebody in there that should not be in there and our country will be destroyed and we're not going to stand for that.
For years, Democrats have gotten away with election fraud and weak Republicans. And that's what they are. There's so many weak Republicans. And we have great ones. Jim Jordan and some of these guys, they're out there fighting. The House guys are fighting. But it's, it's incredible.
Many of the Republicans, I helped them get in, I helped them get elected. I helped Mitch get elected. I helped. I could name 24 of them, let's say, I won't bore you with it. And then all of a sudden you have something like this. It's like, ""Oh gee, maybe I'll talk to the president sometime later."" No, it's amazing.
They're weak Republicans, they're pathetic Republicans and that's what happens.
If this happened to the Democrats, there'd be hell all over the country going on. There'd be hell all over the country. But just remember this: You're stronger, you're smarter, you've got more going than anybody. And they try and demean everybody having to do with us. And you're the real people, you're the people that built this nation. You're not the people that tore down our nation.
The weak Republicans, and that's it. I really believe it. I think I'm going to use the term, the weak Republicans. You've got a lot of them. And you got a lot of great ones. But you got a lot of weak ones. They've turned a blind eye, even as Democrats enacted policies that chipped away our jobs, weakened our military, threw open our borders and put America last.
Did you see the other day where Joe Biden said, I want to get rid of the America First policy? What's that all about? Get rid of. How do you say I want to get rid of America First? Even if you're going to do it, don't talk about it, right? Unbelievable what we have to go through. What we have to go through.
And you have to get your people to fight. And if they don't fight, we have to primary the hell out of the ones that don't fight. You primary them. We're going to. We're going to let you know who they are. I can already tell you, frankly.
But this year, using the pretext of the China virus and the scam of mail-in ballots, Democrats attempted the most brazen and outrageous election theft and there's never been anything like this. So pure theft in American history. Everybody knows it.
That election, our election was over at 10 o'clock in the evening. We're leading Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia, by hundreds of thousands of votes.
And then late in the evening, or early in the morning, boom, these explosions of bull****.
And all of a sudden. All of a sudden it started to happen.
(Audience chants: ""Bull****."")
Don't forget when Romney got beat. Romney, hey. Did you see his? I wonder if he enjoyed his flight in last night. But when Romney got beaten, you know, he stands up like you're more typical, ""Well, I'd like to congratulate the victor."" The victor? Who is the victor, Mitt? ""I'd like to congratulate."" They don't go and look at the facts. No, I don't know. He got, he got slaughtered. Probably, maybe it was OK, maybe it was. But that's what happened.
But we look at the facts and our election was so corrupt that in the history of this country we've never seen anything like it. You can go all the way back.
You know, America is blessed with elections. All over the world they talk about our elections. You know what the world says about us now? They said, we don't have free and fair elections.
And you know what else? We don't have a free and fair press. Our media is not free, it's not fair. It suppresses thought, it suppresses speech and it's become the enemy of the people. It's become the enemy of the people. It's the biggest problem we have in this country.
No third-world countries would even attempt to do what we caught them doing. And you'll hear about that in just a few minutes.
Republicans are, Republicans are constantly fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back. It's like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including bad people. And we're going to have to fight much harder.
And Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn't, that will be a, a sad day for our country because you're sworn to uphold our Constitution.
Now, it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we're going to walk down, and I'll be there with you, we're going to walk down, we're going to walk down.
Anyone you want, but I think right here, we're going to walk down to the Capitol, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.
Because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong. We have come to demand that Congress do the right thing and only count the electors who have been lawfully slated, lawfully slated.
I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.
Today we will see whether Republicans stand strong for integrity of our elections. But whether or not they stand strong for our country, our country. Our country has been under siege for a long time. Far longer than this four-year period. We've set it on a much greater course. So much, and we, I thought, you know, four more years. I thought it would be easy.
We've created the greatest economy in history. We rebuilt our military. We get you the biggest tax cuts in history. Right? We got you the biggest regulation cuts. There's no president, whether it's four years, eight years or in one case more, got anywhere near the regulation cuts.
Used to take 20 years to get a highway approved, now we're down to two. I want to get it down to one, but we're down to two. And it may get rejected for environmental or safety reasons, but we got it down to safety.
We created Space Force, We, we, we. Look at what we did. Our military has been totally rebuilt. So we create Space Force which, by and of itself, is a major achievement for an administration. And with us it's one of so many different things.
Right to Try. Everybody know about Right to Try. We did things that nobody ever thought possible. We took care of our vets, our vets. The VA now has the highest rating, 91%. The highest rating that it's had from the beginning, 91% approval rating. Always, you watch the VA, it was on television every night, people living in a horrible, horrible manner. We got that done. We got accountability done. We got it so that now in the VA, you don't have to wait for four weeks, six weeks, eight weeks, four months to see a doctor. If you can't get a doctor, you go outside, you get the doctor. You have it taken care of and we pay the doctor.
And we've not only made life wonderful for so many people, we've saved tremendous amounts of money, far secondarily, but we've saved a lot of money. And now we have the right to fire bad people in the VA. We had 9,000 people that treated our veterans horribly. In primetime, they would not have treated our veterans badly. But they treated our veterans horribly.
And we have what's called the account, VA Accountability Act. And the accountability says if we see somebody in there that doesn't treat our vets well or they steal, they rob, they do things badly, we say: ""Joe you're fired. Get out of here."" Before you couldn't do that. You couldn't do that before.
So we've taken care of things, we've done things like nobody's ever thought possible. And that's part of the reason that many people don't like us, because we've done too much.
But we've done it quickly and we were going to sit home and watch a big victory and everybody had us down for a victory. It was going to be great and now we're out here fighting. I said to somebody, I was going to take a few days and relax after our big electoral victory. 10 o'clock it was over. But I was going to take a few days.
And I can say this. Since our election, I believe, which was such a catastrophe, when I watch. And even these guys knew what happened. They know what happened. They're saying: ""Wow, Pennsylvania's insurmountable. Wow, Wisconsin."" Look at the big leads we had, right. Even though the press said we would lose Wisconsin by 17 points. Even though the press said, Ohio's going to be close, we set a record; Florida's going to be close, we set a record; Texas is going to be close, Texas is going to be close, we set a record.
And we set a record with Hispanic, with the Black community, we set a record with everybody.
Today we see a very important event though. Because right over there, right there, we see the event going to take place. And I'm going to be watching. Because history is going to be made. We're going to see whether or not we have great and courageous leaders, or whether or not we have leaders that should be ashamed of themselves throughout history, throughout eternity they'll be ashamed.
And you know what? If they do the wrong thing, we should never, ever forget that they did. Never forget. We should never ever forget.
With only three of the seven states in question, we win the presidency of the United States. And by the way, it's much more important today than it was 24 hours ago, because I don't. I spoke to David Perdue, what a great person, and Kelly Loeffler, two great people, but it was a setup.
And you know, I said, ""We have no backline anymore."" The only backline, the only line of demarcation, the only line that we have is the veto of the president of the United States. So this is now, what we're doing, a far more important election than it was two days ago.
I want to thank the more than 140 members of the House. Those are warriors. They're over there working like you've never seen before. Studying, talking, actually going all the way back, studying the roots of the Constitution, because they know we have the right to send a bad vote that was illegally gotten.
They gave these people bad things to vote for and they voted because what did they know? And then when they found out a few weeks later, again, it took them four years to devise this screen.
And the only unhappy person in the United States, single most unhappy, is Hillary Clinton. Because she said: ""Why didn't you do this for me four years ago? Why didn't you do this for me four years ago? Change the votes, 10,000 in Michigan. You could have changed the whole thing."" But she's not too happy. You know, you don't see her anymore. What happened? Where's Hillary? Where is she?
But I want to thank all of those congressmen and women. I also want to thank our 13, most courageous members of the U.S. Senate. Senator Ted Cruz, Senator Ron Johnson, Senator Josh Hawley, Kelly Loeffler.
And Kelly Loeffler, I'll tell you, she has been, she's been so great. She worked so hard. So let's give her and David a little special hand because it was rigged against them. Let's give her and David.
Kelly Loeffler, David Purdue. They fought a good race. They never had a shot. That equipment should never have been allowed to be used, and I was telling these people don't let him use this stuff.
Marsha Blackburn, terrific person. Mike Braun, Indiana. Steve Daines, great guy. Bill Hagerty, John Kennedy, James Lankford, Cynthia Lummis, Tommy Tuberville, the coach, and Roger Marshall. We want to thank them. Senators that stepped up, we want to thank them.
I actually think though, it takes, again, more courage not to step up, and I think a lot of those people are going to find that out and you better start looking at your leadership, because your leadership has led you down the tubes.
You know, we don't want to give $2,000 to people. We want to give them $600. Oh, great. How does that play politically? Pretty good? And this has nothing to do with politics, but how does it play politically?
China destroyed these people. We didn't destroy. China destroy them, totally destroyed them. We want to give them $600 and they just wouldn't change.
I said give them $2,000, we'll pay it back. We'll pay it back fast. You already owe 26 trillion, give them a couple of bucks. Let them live. Give them a couple of bucks. And some of the people here disagree with me on that, but I just say, ""Look, you've got to let people live.""
And how does that play though? OK. Number one, it's the right thing to do. But how does that play politically? I think it's the primary reason, one of the primary reasons, the other was just pure cheating. That was the primary, super primary reason. But you can't do that, you got to use your head.
As you know, the media has constantly asserted the outrageous lie that there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Have you ever seen these people? While there is no evidence of fraud. Oh, really? Well, I'm going to read you pages. I hope you don't get bored listening to it. Promise? Don't get bored listening to it, all those hundreds of thousands of people back there. Move them up, please, yeah.
All they, all these people, don't get bored, don't get angry at me because you're going to get bored because it's so much.
The American people do not believe the corrupt, fake news anymore. They have ruined their reputation. But you know, it used to be that they'd argue with me. I'd fight. So I'd fight, they'd fight, I'd fight, they'd fight. Pop pop. You'd believe me, you'd believe them. Somebody comes out. You know, they had their point of view, I had my point of view, but you'd have an argument.
Now what they do is they go silent. It's called suppression and that's what happens in a communist country. That's what they do, they suppress. You don't fight with them anymore. Unless it's a bad story. They have a little bad story about me, they make it 10 times worse and it's a major headline.
But Hunter Biden, they don't talk about him. What happened to Hunter? Where's Hunter? Where's Hunter? They don't talk about him. They'll watch, all the sets will go off. Well, they can't do that because they get good ratings. Their ratings are too good. Now, where's Hunter? You know.
And how come Joe is allowed to give a billion dollars of money to get rid of the prosecutor in Ukraine? How does that happen? I'd ask you that question. How does that happen? Can you imagine if I said that? If I said that it would be a whole different ballgame.
And how come Hunter gets three and a half million dollars from the mayor of Moscow's wife, and gets hundreds of thousands of dollars to sit on an energy board, even though he admits he has no knowledge of energy? And millions of dollars up front.
And how come they go into China and they leave with billions of dollars to manage. ""Have you managed money before?"" ""No, I haven't."" ""Oh, that's good. Here's about 3 billion."" No, they don't talk about that.
No, we have a corrupt media. They've gone silent. They've gone dead. I now realize how good it was if you go back 10 years, I realized how good, even though I didn't necessarily love them, I realized how good. It was like a cleansing motion, right?
But we don't have that anymore. We don't have a fair media anymore. It's suppression. And you have to be very careful with that and they've lost all credibility in this country.
We will not be intimidated into accepting the hoaxes and the lies that we've been forced to believe.
Over the past several weeks, we've amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election. This is the presidential election. Last night was a little bit better because of the fact that we had a lot of eyes watching one specific state, but they cheated like hell anyway.
You have one of the dumbest governors in the United States. And you know when I endorsed him, and I didn't know this guy, at the request of David Perdue, he said, ""Friend of mine's running for governor."" ""What's his name?"" And you know the rest. He was in fourth place, fifth place. I don't know, he was, he was doing poorly. I endorse him, he went like a rocket ship and he won.
And then I had to beat Stacey Abrams with this guy, Brian Kemp. I had to beat Stacey Abrams. And I had to beat Oprah, used to be a friend of mine. You know, I was on her last show, her last week, she picked the five outstanding people. I don't think she thinks that any more. Once I ran for president, I didn't notice there were too many calls coming in from Oprah. Believe it or not, she used to like me. But I was one of the five outstanding people.
And I had a campaign against Michelle Obama and Barack Hussein Obama, against Stacey.
And I had Brian Kemp, who weighs 130 pounds. He said he played offensive line in football. I'm trying to figure that out. I'm still trying to figure that out. He said that the other night, ""I was an offensive lineman."" I'm saying: ""Really? That must have been a very small team."" But I look at that and I look at what's happened and he turned out to be a disaster. This stuff happens.
You know, look, I'm not happy with the Supreme Court. They love to rule against me. I picked three people. I fought like hell for them. One in particular, I fought. They all said, ""Sir, cut him loose."" He's killing the senators. You know, very loyal senators, they're very loyal people, ""Sir, cut him loose, he's killing us, sir, cut him loose."" I must have gotten half of the senators.
I said: ""No, I can't do that, it's unfair to him and it's unfair to the family. He didn't do anything wrong."" They made up stories, they're all made-up stories. He didn't do anything wrong. ""Cut him loose, sir."" I said, ""No, I won't do that. We got him through."" And you know what, they couldn't give a damn. They couldn't give a damn. Let him rule the right way.
But it almost seems that they're all going out of their way to hurt all of us and to hurt our country. To hurt our country.
You know, I read a story in one of the newspapers recently how I control the three Supreme Court justices. I control them. They're puppets.
I read it about Bill Barr, that he's my personal attorney. That he'll do anything for me. And I said, ""You know, it really is genius."" Because what they do is that, and it makes it really impossible for them to ever give you a victory, because all of a sudden Bill Barr changed. If you hadn't noticed. I like Bill Barr, but he changed, because he didn't want to be considered my personal attorney.
And the Supreme Court, they rule against me so much. You know why? Because the story is — I haven't spoken to any of them, any of them, since virtually they got in — but the story is that they're my puppets. Right? That they're puppets.
And now the only way they can get out of that because they hate that it's not good in the social circuit. And the only way they get out is to rule against Trump. So let's rule against Trump. And they do that. So I want to congratulate them.
But it shows you the media's genius. In fact, probably if I was the media, I'd do it the same way. I hate to say it. But we got to get them straightened out.
Today, for the sake of our democracy, for the sake of our Constitution, and for the sake of our children, we lay out the case for the entire world to hear. You want to hear it?
(Audience responds: ""Yeah"")
In every single swing state, local officials, state officials, almost all Democrats, made illegal and unconstitutional changes to election procedures without the mandated approvals by the state legislatures.
That these changes paved a way for fraud on a scale never seen before. I think we go a long way outside of our country when I say that.
So, just in a nutshell, you can't make a change or voting for a federal election unless the state legislature approves it. No judge can do it. Nobody can do it. Only a legislature.
So as an example, in Pennsylvania, or whatever, you have a Republican legislature, you have a Democrat mayor, and you have a lot of Democrats all over the place. They go to the legislature. The legislature laughs at them, says we're not going to do that. They say, thank you very much and they go and make the changes themselves, they do it anyway. And that's totally illegal. That's totally illegal. You can't do that.
In Pennsylvania, the Democrat secretary of state and the Democrat state Supreme Court justices illegally abolished the signature verification requirements just 11 days prior to the election.
So think of what they did. No longer is there signature verification. Oh, that's OK. We want voter ID by the way. But no longer is there a signature verification. Eleven days before the election they say we don't want it. You know why they don't want to? Because they want to cheat. That's the only reason.
Who would even think of that? We don't want to verify a signature?
There were over 205,000 more ballots counted in Pennsylvania. Think of this, you had 205,000 more ballots than you had voters. That means you had two. Where did they come from? You know where they came from? Somebody's imagination, whatever they needed.
So in Pennsylvania, you had 205,000 more votes than you had voters. And the number is actually much greater than that now. That was as of a week ago. And this is a mathematical impossibility unless you want to say it's a total fraud.
So Pennsylvania was defrauded. Over 8,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were cast by people whose names and dates of birth match individuals who died in 2020 and prior to the election. Think of that. Dead people, lots of dead people, thousands. And some dead people actually requested an application. That bothers me even more.
Not only are they voting, they want an application to vote. One of them was 29 years ago, died. It's incredible. Over 14,000 ballots were cast by out-of-state voters, so these are voters that don't live in this state.
And by the way, these numbers are what they call outcome-determinative, meaning these numbers far surpass. I lost by a very little bit. These numbers are massive, massive.
More than 10,000 votes in Pennsylvania were illegally counted, even though they were received after Election Day. In other words, they were received after Election Day. Let's count them anyway.
And what they did in many cases is, they did fraud. They took the date and they moved it back so that it no longer is after Election Day. And more than 60,000 ballots in Pennsylvania were reported received back. They got back before they were ever supposedly mailed out. In other words, you got the ballot back before you mailed it, which is also logically and logistically impossible, right?
Think of that one. You got the ballot back. Let's send the ballots. Oh, they've already been sent. But we got the ballot back before they were sent. I don't think that's too good, right?
Twenty-five thousand ballots in Pennsylvania were requested by nursing home residents, all in a single giant batch, not legal, indicating an enormous, illegal ballot harvesting operation. You're not allowed to do it, it's against the law.
The day before the election, the state of Pennsylvania reported the number of absentee ballots that had been sent out. Yet this number was suddenly and drastically increased by 400,000 people. It was increased, nobody knows where it came from, by 400,000 ballots, one day after the election.
It remains totally unexplained. They said, ""Well, ah, we can't figure that."" Now, that's many, many times what it would take to overthrow the state. Just that one element. Four hundred thousand ballots appeared from nowhere right after the election.
By the way, Pennsylvania has now seen all of this. They didn't know because it was so quick. They had a vote. They voted. But now they see all this stuff, it's all come to light. Doesn't happen that fast. And they want to recertify their votes. They want to recertify. But the only way that can happen is if Mike Pence agrees to send it back. Mike Pence has to agree to send it back.
(Audience chants: ""Send it back."")
And many people in Congress want it sent back.
And think of what you're doing. Let's say you don't do it. Somebody says, ""Well, we have to obey the Constitution."" And you are, because you're protecting our country and you're protecting the Constitution. So you are.
But think of what happens. Let's say they're stiffs and they're stupid people, and they say, well, we really have no choice. Even though Pennsylvania and other states want to redo their votes. They want to see the numbers. They already have the numbers. Go very quickly. And they want to redo their legislature because many of these votes were taken, as I said, because it wasn't approved by their legislature. You know, that, in itself, is legal. And then you have the scam, and that's all of the things that we're talking about.
But think of this. If you don't do that, that means you will have a president of the United States for four years, with his wonderful son. You will have a president who lost all of these states. Or you will have a president, to put it another way, who was voted on by a bunch of stupid people who lost all of these states.
You will have an illegitimate president. That's what you'll have. And we can't let that happen.
These are the facts that you won't hear from the fake news media. It's all part of the suppression effort. They don't want to talk about it. They don't want to talk about it. In fact, when I started talking about that, I guarantee you, a lot of the television sets and a lot of those cameras went off. And that's a lot of cameras back there. But a lot of them went off.
But these are the things you don't hear about. You don't hear what you just heard. I'm going to go over a few more states. But you don't hear it by the people who want to deceive you and demoralize you and control you. Big tech, media.
Just like the suppression polls that said we're going lose Wisconsin by 17 points. Well, we won Wisconsin. They don't have it that way because they lost just by a little sliver. But they had me down the day before, Washington Post/ABC poll, down 17 points.
I called up a real pollster. I said, ""What is that?"" ""Sir, that's called a suppression poll. I think you're going to win Wisconsin, sir.""
I said, ""But why don't they make it four or five points?"" Because then people vote. But when you're down 17, they say, ""Hey, I'm not going to waste my time. I love the president, but there's no way.""
Despite that, despite that, we won Wisconsin. It's going to see. I mean, you'll see. But that's called suppression because a lot of people when they see that. It's very interesting. This pollster said, ""Sir, if you're down three, four, or five people vote. When you go down 17, they say, 'Let's save. Let's go and have dinner and let's watch the presidential defeat tonight on television, darling.'""
And just like the radical left tries to blacklist you on social media. Every time I put out a tweet, that's, even if it's totally correct, totally correct, I get a flag. I get a flag.
And they also don't let you get out. You know, on Twitter, it's very hard to come onto my account. It's very hard to get out a message. They don't let the message get out nearly like they should. But I've had many people say, ""I can't get on your Twitter."" I don't care about Twitter. Twitter's bad news. They're all bad news.
But you know what, if you want to, if you want to get out a message and if you want to go through Big tech, social media, they are really, if you're a conservative, if you're a Republican, if you have a big voice, I guess they call it shadow banned, right? Shadow banned. They shadow ban you, and it should be illegal.
I've been telling these Republicans, get rid of Section 230. And for some reason, Mitch and the group, they don't want to put it in there and they don't realize that that's going to be the end of the Republican Party as we know it, but it's never going to be the end of us. Never. Let them get out. Let, let the weak ones get out. This is a time for strength.
They also want to indoctrinate your children in school by teaching them things that aren't so. They want to indoctrinate your children. It's all part of the comprehensive assault on our democracy, and the American people are finally standing up and saying no. This crowd is, again, a testament to it.
I did no advertising, I did nothing. You do have some groups that are big supporters. I want to thank that, Amy, and everybody. We have some incredible supporters, incredible. But we didn't do anything. This just happened. Two months ago, we had a massive crowd come down to Washington. I said, ""What are they there for?"" ""Sir, they're there for you.""
We have nothing to do with it. These groups are for, they're forming all over the United States. And we got to remember, in a year from now, you're going to start working on Congress and we got to get rid of the weak Congress, people, the ones that aren't any good, the Liz Cheneys of the world. We got to get rid of them. We got to get rid.
You know, she never wants a soldier brought home — I brought a lot of our soldiers home. I don't know, somewhat like it. They're in countries that nobody even knows the name, nobody knows where they are. They're dying. They're great, but they're dying. They're losing their arms, their legs, their face. I brought them back home, largely back home. Afghanistan, Iraq.
Remember, I used to say in the old days: ""Don't go in Iraq. But if you go in, keep the oil."" We didn't keep the oil. So stupid. So stupid these people. And Iraq has billions and billions of dollars now in the bank. And what did we do? We got nothing. We never get. But we do actually, we kept the oil here or we get, we did good.
We got rid of the ISIS caliphate. We got rid of plenty of different things that everybody knows and the rebuilding of our military in three years. People said it couldn't be done. And it was all made in the USA, all made in the USA, best equipment in the world.
In Wisconsin, corrupt Democrat-run cities deployed more than 500 illegal, unmanned, unsecured drop boxes, which collected a minimum of 91,000 unlawful votes. It was razor-thin, the loss. This one thing alone is much more than we would need. But there are many things.
They have these lockboxes. And, you know, they'd pick them up and they disappear for two days. People would say where's that box? They disappeared. Nobody even knew where the hell it was.
In addition, over 170,000 absentee votes were counted in Wisconsin without a valid absentee ballot application. So they had a vote, but they had no application, and that's illegal in Wisconsin. Meaning those votes were blatantly done in opposition to state law and they came 100% from Democrat areas such as Milwaukee and Madison, 100%.
In Madison, 17,000 votes were deposited in so-called human drop boxes. You know what that is, right? Where operatives stuff thousands of unsecured ballots into duffle bags on park benches across the city, in complete defiance of cease-and-desist letters from state legislature.
Your state legislatures said don't do it. They're the only ones that can approve it. They gave tens of thousands of votes. They came in in duffle bags. Where the hell did they come from?
According to eyewitness testimony, Postal Service workers in Wisconsin were also instructed to illegally backdate approximately 100,000 ballots. The margin of difference in Wisconsin was less than 20,000 votes. Each one of these things alone wins us the state. Great state. We love the state. We won the state.
In Georgia, your secretary of state who, I can't believe this guy's a Republican. He loves recording telephone conversations. You know, that was? I thought it was a great conversation personally. So did a lot of other. People love that conversation because it says what's going on.
These people are crooked. They're 100%, in my opinion, one of the most corrupt, between your governor and your secretary of state. And now you have it again last night. Just take a look at what happened. What a mess.
And the Democrat Party operatives entered into an illegal and unconstitution — unconstitutional settlement agreement that drastically weakened signature verification and other election security procedures.
Stacey Abrams. She took them to lunch. And I beat her two years ago with a bad candidate, Brian Kemp. But they took, the Democrats took the Republicans to lunch because the secretary of state had no clue what the hell was happening. Unless he did have a clue. That's interesting. Maybe he was with the other side.
But we've been trying to get verifications of signatures in Fulton County, they won't let us do it. The only reason they won't is because we'll find things in the hundreds of thousands. Why wouldn't they let us verify signatures in Fulton County, which is known for being very corrupt. They won't do it. They go to some other county where you would live.
I said, ""That's not the problem."" The problem is Fulton County, home of Stacey Abrams. She did a good job, I congratulate her. But it was done in such a way that we can't let this stuff happen. We won't have a country if it happens.
As a result, Georgia's absentee ballot rejection rate was more than 10 times lower than previous levels because the criteria was so off.
Forty-eight counties in Georgia, with thousands and thousands of votes, rejected zero ballots. There wasn't one ballot. In other words, in a year in which more mail-in ballots were sent than ever before, and more people were voting by mail for the first time, the rejection rate was drastically lower than it had ever been before.
The only way this can be explained is if tens of thousands of illegitimate votes were added to the tally. That's the only way you could explain it.
By the way, you're talking about tens of thousands. If Georgia had merely rejected the same number of unlawful ballots as in other years, they should have been approximately 45,000 ballots rejected. Far more than what we needed to win, just over 11,000. They should find those votes. They should absolutely find that. Just over 11,000 votes, that's all we need. They defrauded us out of a win in Georgia, and we're not going to forget it.
There's only one reason the Democrats could possibly want to eliminate signature matching, opposed voter ID, and stop citizenship confirmation. ""Are you a citizenship?"" You're not allowed to ask that question, because they want to steal the election.
The radical left knows exactly what they're doing. They're ruthless and it's time that somebody did something about it. And Mike Pence, I hope you're going to stand up for the good of our Constitution and for the good of our country. And if you're not, I'm going to be very disappointed in you. I will tell you right now. I'm not hearing good stories.
In Fulton County, Republican poll watchers were ejected, in some cases, physically from the room under the false pretense of a pipe burst. Water main burst, everybody leave. Which we now know was a total lie.
Then election officials pull boxes, Democrats, and suitcases of ballots out from under a table. You all saw it on television, totally fraudulent. And illegally scanned them for nearly two hours, totally unsupervised. Tens of thousands of votes. This act coincided with a mysterious vote dump of up to 100,000 votes for Joe Biden, almost none for Trump. Oh, that sounds fair. That was at 1:34 a.m.
The Georgia secretary of state and pathetic governor of Georgia, have reached, although he says I'm a great president. You know, I sort of maybe have to change. He said the other day, ""Yes, I do. I disagree with president, but he's been a great president."" Good, thanks. Thank you very much.
Because of him and others, you have Brian Kemp. Vote him the hell out of office, please. Well, his rates are so low. You know, his approval rating now, I think it just reached a record low.
They've rejected five separate appeals for an independent and comprehensive audit of signatures in Fulton County. Even without an audit, the number of fraudulent ballots that we've identified across the state is staggering.
Over 10,300 ballots in Georgia were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Georgia residents who died in 2020 and prior to the election.
More than 2,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match incarcerated felons in Georgia prison. People who are not allowed to vote.
More than 4,500 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who do not appear on the state's own voter rolls.
Over 18,000 illegal ballots were cast by individuals who registered to vote using an address listed as vacant, according to the Postal Service.
At least 88,000 ballots in Georgia were cast by people whose registrations were illegally backdated.
Sixty-six thousand votes, each one of these is far more than we need. Sixty-six thousand votes in Georgia were cast by individuals under the legal voting age.
And at least 15,000 ballots were cast by individuals who moved out of the state prior to November 3 election. They say they moved right back. They moved right back. Oh, they moved out, they moved right back. OK. They missed Georgia that much. I do. I love Georgia, but it's a corrupt system.
Despite all of this, the margin in Georgia is only 11,779 votes.
Each and every one of these issues is enough to give us a victory in Georgia, a big beautiful victory. Make no mistake, this election was stolen from you, from me and from the country.
And not a single swing state has conducted a comprehensive audit to remove the illegal ballots. This should absolutely occur in every single contested state before the election is certified.
In the state of Arizona, over 36,000 ballots were illegally cast by non-citizens. Two thousand ballots were returned with no address. More than 22,000 ballots were returned before they were ever supposedly mailed out. They returned, but we haven't mailed them yet.
Eleven thousand six hundred more ballots and votes were counted, more than there were actual voters. You see that? So you have more votes again than you have voters.
One hundred and fifty thousand people registered in Maricopa County after the registration deadline. One hundred and three thousand ballots in the county were sent for electronic adjudication with no Republican observers.
In Clark County, Nevada, the accuracy settings on signature verification machines were purposely lowered before they were used to count over 130,000 ballots.
If you signed your name as Santa Claus, it would go through.
There were also more than 42,000 double votes in Nevada. Over 150,000 people were hurt so badly by what took place. And 1,500 ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match Nevada residents who died in 2020 prior to November 3 election. More than 8,000 votes were cast by individuals who had no address and probably didn't live there.
The margin in Nevada is down at a very low number, any of these things would have taken care of the situation. We would have won Nevada, also. Every one of these we're going over, we win.
In Michigan, quickly, the secretary of state, a real great one, flooded the state with unsolicited mail-in ballot applications sent to every person on the rolls in direct violation of state law.
More than 17,000 Michigan ballots were cast by individuals whose names and dates of birth match people who were deceased.
In Wayne County, that's a great one. That's Detroit. One hundred and seventy-four thousand ballots were counted without being tied to an actual registered voter. Nobody knows where they came from.
Also, in Wayne County, poll watchers observed canvassers rescanning batches of ballots over and over again, up to three or four or five times.
In Detroit, turnout was 139% of registered voters. Think of that. So you had 139% of the people in Detroit voting. This is in Michigan. Detroit, Michigan.
A career employee of the Detroit, City of Detroit, testified under penalty of perjury that she witnessed city workers coaching voters to vote straight Democrat while accompanying them to watch who they voted for. When a Republican came in, they wouldn't talk to him.
The same worker was instructed not to ask for any voter ID and not to attempt to validate any signatures if they were Democrats. She also told to illegally, and was told, backdate ballots received after the deadline and reports that thousands and thousands of ballots were improperly backdated. That's Michigan.
Four witnesses have testified under penalty of perjury that after officials in Detroit announced the last votes had been counted, tens of thousands of additional ballots arrived without required envelopes. Every single one was for a Democrat. I got no votes.
At 6:31 a.m. in the early morning hours after voting had ended, Michigan suddenly reported 147,000 votes. An astounding 94% went to Joe Biden, who campaigned brilliantly from his basement. Only a couple of percentage points went to Trump.
Such gigantic and one-sided vote dumps were only observed in a few swing states and they were observed in the states where it was necessary.
You know what's interesting? President Obama beat Biden in every state other than the swing states where Biden killed them, but the swing states were the ones that mattered.
They're always just enough to push Joe Biden barely into the lead. We were ahead by a lot and within a number of hours we were losing by a little.
In addition, there is the highly troubling matter of Dominion Voting Systems. In one Michigan county alone, 6,000 votes were switched from Trump to Biden and the same systems are used in the majority of states in our country.
Senator William Ligon, a great gentleman, chairman of Georgia's senate judiciary subcommittee. Senator Ligon, highly respected, on elections has written a letter describing his concerns with Dominion in Georgia.
He wrote, and I quote, The Dominion Voting Machines employed in Fulton County had an astronomical and astounding 93.67% error rate. It's only wrong 93% of the time in the scanning of ballots requiring a review panel to adjudicate or determine the voter's interest in over 106,000 ballots out of a total of 113,000.
Think of it. You go in and you vote and then they tell people who you supposed to be voting for. They make up whatever they want. Nobody's ever even heard.
They adjudicate your vote. They say, Well, we don't think Trump wants to vote for Trump. We think he wants to vote for Biden. Put it down for Biden.
The national average for such an error rate is far less than 1% and yet you're at 93%. The source of this astronomical error rate must be identified to determine if these machines were set up or destroyed to allow for a third party to disregard the actual ballot cast by the registered voter.
The letter continues. There is clear evidence that tens of thousands of votes were switched from President Trump to former Vice President Biden in several counties in Georgia.
For example, in Bibb County, President Trump was reported to have 29,391 votes at 9:11 p.m. Eastern time, while simultaneously Vice President Joe Biden was reported to have 17,213. Minutes later, just minutes, at the next update, these vote numbers switched with President Trump going way down to 17,000 and Biden going way up to 29,391. And that was very quick, a 12,000 vote switch all in Mr. Biden's favor.
So, I mean, I could go on and on about this fraud that took place in every state, and all of these legislatures want this back. I don't want to do it to you because I love you and it's freezing out here. But I could just go on forever. I can tell you this.
(Audience chants: ""We love you."")
So when you hear, when you hear, while there is no evidence to prove any wrongdoing, this is the most fraudulent thing anybody has, this is a criminal enterprise. This is a criminal enterprise. And the press will say, and I'm sure they won't put any of that on there, because that's no good. And you ever see, while there is no evidence to back President Trump's assertion.
I could go on for another hour reading this stuff to you and telling you about it. There's never been anything like it.
Think about it. Detroit had more votes than it had voters. Pennsylvania had 205,000 more votes than it had more. But you don't have to go any. Between that, I think that's almost better than dead people if you think, right? More votes than they had voters. And many other states also.
It's a disgrace that the United States of America, tens of millions of people, are allowed to go vote without so much as even showing identification.
In no state is there any question or effort made to verify the identity, citizenship, residency or eligibility of the votes cast.
The Republicans have to get tougher. You're not going to have a Republican Party if you don't get tougher. They want to play so straight. They want to play so, sir, yes, the United States. The Constitution doesn't allow me to send them back to the States. Well, I say, yes it does, because the Constitution says you have to protect our country and you have to protect our Constitution, and you can't vote on fraud. And fraud breaks up everything, doesn't it? When you catch somebody in a fraud, you're allowed to go by very different rules.
So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do. And I hope he doesn't listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he's listening to.
It is also widely understood that the voter rolls are crammed full of non-citizens, felons and people who have moved out of state and individuals who are otherwise ineligible to vote. Yet Democrats oppose every effort to clean up their voter rolls. They don't want to clean them up. They're loaded.
And how many people here know other people, that when there are hundreds of thousands and then millions of ballots got sent out, got three, four, five, six, and I heard one, who got seven ballots. And then they say you didn't quite make it, sir.
We won in a landslide. This was a landslide. They said it's not American to challenge the election. This the most corrupt election in the history, maybe of the world.
You know, you could go third-world countries, but I don't think they had hundreds of thousands of votes and they don't have voters for them. I mean no matter where you go, nobody would think this.
In fact, it's so egregious, it's so bad that a lot of people don't even believe it. It's so crazy that people don't even believe it. It can't be true. So they don't believe it.
This is not just a matter of domestic politics — this is a matter of national security.
So today, in addition to challenging the certification of the election, I'm calling on Congress and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping election reforms, and you better do it before we have no country left.
Today is not the end, it's just the beginning.
With your help over the last four years, we built the greatest political movement in the history of our country and nobody even challenges that.
I say that over and over, and I never get challenged by the fakeness, and they challenge almost everything we say.
But our fight against the big donors, big media, big tech, and others is just getting started. This is the greatest in history. There's never been a movement like that.
You look back there all the way to the Washington Monument. It's hard to believe.
We must stop the steal and then we must ensure that such outrageous election fraud never happens again, can never be allowed to happen again.
But we're going forward. We'll take care of going forward. We've got to take care of going back. Don't let them talk. OK, well, we promised. I've had a lot of people. Sir, you're at 96% for four years. I said I'm not interested right now. I'm interested in right there.
With your help, we will finally pass powerful requirements for voter ID. You need an ID to cash a check. You need an ID to go to a bank, to buy alcohol, to drive a car. Every person should need to show an ID in order to cast your most important thing, a vote.
We will also require proof of American citizenship in order to vote in American elections. We just had a good victory in court on that one, actually.
We will ban ballot harvesting and prohibit the use of unsecured drop boxes to commit rampant fraud. These drop boxes are fraudulent. Therefore, they get disapp — they disappear, and then all of a sudden they show up. It's fraudulent.
We will stop the practice of universal unsolicited mail-in balloting.
We will clean up the voter rolls that ensure that every single person who casts a vote is a citizen of our country, a resident of the state in which they vote and their vote is cast in a lawful and honest manner.
We will restore the vital civic tradition of in-person voting on Election Day so that voters can be fully informed when they make their choice.
We will finally hold big tech accountable. And if these people had courage and guts, they would get rid of Section 230, something that no other company, no other person in America, in the world has.
All of these tech monopolies are going to abuse their power and interfere in our elections, and it has to be stopped. And the Republicans have to get a lot tougher, and so should the Democrats. They should be regulated, investigated, and brought to justice under the fullest extent of the law. They're totally breaking the law.
Together, we will drain the Washington swamp and we will clean up the corruption in our nation's capital. We have done a big job on it, but you think it's easy. It's a dirty business. It's a dirty business. You have a lot of bad people out there.
Despite everything we've been through, looking out all over this country and seeing fantastic crowds. Although this, I think, is our all-time record. I think you have 250,000 people. 250,000.
Looking out at all the amazing patriots here today, I have never been more confident in our nation's future. Well, I have to say, we have to be a little bit careful. That's a nice statement, but we have to be a little careful with that statement.
If we allow this group of people to illegally take over our country because it's illegal when the votes are illegal when the way they got there is illegal when the states that vote are given false and fraudulent information.
We are the greatest country on Earth and we are headed and were headed in the right direction.
You know, the wall is built. We're doing record numbers at the wall. Now, they want to take down the wall. Let's let everyone flow in. Let's let everybody flow in. We did a great job in the wall. Remember, the wall, they said it could never be done. One of the largest infrastructure projects we've ever had in this country, and it's had a tremendous impact, that we got rid of catch and release. We got rid of all of this stuff that we had to live with.
But now, the caravans, I think Biden's getting in, the caravans are forming again. They want to come in again and rip off our country. Can't let it happen.
As this enormous crowd shows, we have truth and justice on our side. We have a deep and enduring love for America in our hearts. We love our country.
We have overwhelming pride in this great country and we have it deep in our souls. Together, we are determined to defend and preserve government of the people, by the people and for the people.
Our brightest days are before us. Our greatest achievements, still away.
I think one of our great achievements will be election security. Because nobody until I came along had any idea how corrupt our elections were.
And again, most people would stand there at 9 o'clock in the evening and say I want to thank you very much, and they go off to some other life. But I said something's wrong here, something is really wrong, can have happened.
And we fight. We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.
Our exciting adventures and boldest endeavors have not yet begun. My fellow Americans, for our movement, for our children, and for our beloved country.
And I say this despite all that's happened. The best is yet to come.
So we're going to, we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I love Pennsylvania Avenue. And we're going to the Capitol, and we're going to try and give.
The Democrats are hopeless — they never vote for anything. Not even one vote. But we're going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones because the strong ones don't need any of our help. We're going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.
So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.
I want to thank you all. God bless you and God Bless America.
Thank you all for being here. This is incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you.

Relief flowed through Facebook in the days after the 2020 presidential election. The company had cracked down on misinformation, foreign interference and hate speech — and employees believed they had largely succeeded in limiting problems that, four years earlier, had brought on perhaps the most serious crisis in Facebook’s scandal-plagued history.
“It was like we could take a victory lap,” said a former employee, one of many who spoke for this story on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive matters. “There was a lot of the feeling of high-fiving in the office.”
Many who had worked on the election, exhausted from months of unrelenting toil, took leaves of absence or moved on to other jobs. Facebook rolled back many of the dozens of election-season measures that it had used to suppress hateful, deceptive content. A ban the company had imposed on the original Stop the Steal group stopped short of addressing dozens of look-alikes that popped up in what an internal Facebook after-action report, first reported by BuzzFeed News, called “coordinated” and “meteoric” growth. Meanwhile, the company’s Civic Integrity team was largely disbanded by a management that had grown weary of the team’s criticisms of the company, according to former employees.
But the high-fives, it soon became clear, were premature.
On Jan. 6, Facebook staffers expressed their horror in internal messages as they watched thousands of Trump supporters shouting “stop the steal” and bearing the symbols of QAnon — a violent ideology that had spread widely on Facebook before an eventual crackdown — thronged the U.S. Capitol. Many bashed their way inside and battled to halt the constitutionally mandated certification of President Biden’s election victory.
How one of America’s ugliest days unraveled inside and outside the Capitol
Measures of online mayhem surged alarmingly on Facebook, with user reports of “false news” hitting nearly 40,000 per hour, an internal report that day showed. On Facebook-owned Instagram, the account reported most often for inciting violence was @realdonaldtrump — the president’s official account, the report showed.
Facebook has never publicly disclosed what it knows about how its platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp, helped fuel that day’s mayhem. The company rejected its own Oversight Board’s recommendation that it study how its policies contributed to the violence and has yet to fully comply with requests for data from the congressional commission investigating the events.
But thousands of pages of internal company documents disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission by the whistleblower Frances Haugen offer important new evidence of Facebook’s role in the events. This story is based on those documents, as well as on others independently obtained by The Washington Post, and on interviews with current and former Facebook employees. The documents include outraged posts on Workplace, an internal message system.
“This is not a new problem,” one unnamed employee fumed on Workplace on Jan. 6. “We have been watching this behavior from politicians like Trump, and the — at best — wishy washy actions of company leadership, for years now. We have been reading the [farewell] posts from trusted, experienced and loved colleagues who write that they simply cannot conscience working for a company that does not do more to mitigate the negative effects on its platform.”
The SEC documents, which were provided to Congress in redacted form by Haugen’s legal counsel and reviewed by The Post and other news organizations, suggest that Facebook moved too quickly after the election to lift measures that had helped suppress some election-related misinformation.
The rushed effort to restore them on Jan. 6 was not enough to stop the surge of hateful, violent posts, documents show. A company after-action report concluded that in the weeks after the election, Facebook did not act forcefully enough against the Stop the Steal movement that was pushed by Trump’s political allies, even as its presence exploded across the platform.
The documents also provide ample evidence that the company’s internal research over several years had identified ways to diminish the spread of political polarization, conspiracy theories and incitements to violence but that in many instances, executives had declined to implement those steps.
Trump allies, largely unconstrained by Facebook’s rules against repeated falsehoods, cement pre-election dominance
Facebook officials counter that they planned exhaustively for the election and its aftermath, even anticipating the potential for post-election violence, and always expected the challenges to last through Inauguration Day.
They acknowledge rolling back some protective measures in December but said they did so only when measures of problematic content had declined markedly, and that numerous other effective measures remained in place through Jan. 6 and beyond. They laid the blame for the Capitol siege on broader political forces and content that flowed more freely on other online platforms.
“The responsibility for the violence that occurred on January 6 lies with those who attacked our Capitol and those who encouraged them,” spokeswoman Dani Lever said in a statement. “We took steps to limit content that sought to delegitimize the election, including labeling candidates’ posts with the latest vote count after Mr. Trump prematurely declared victory, pausing new political advertising and removing the original #StopTheSteal Group in November.”
She added, ""After the violence at the Capitol erupted and as we saw continued attempts to organize events to dispute the outcome of the presidential election, we removed content with the phrase ‘stop the steal’ under our Coordinating Harm policy and suspended Trump from our platforms.”
But many employees with a close-up view of the company’s actions before and during Jan. 6 emerged from the experience angry and demanding answers. Both feelings were well represented in posts on Workplace and echoed in interviews with The Post.
“Never forget the day Trump rode down the escalator in 2015, called for a ban on Muslims entering the US, [and] we determined that it violated our policies, and yet we explicitly overrode the policy and didn’t take the video down,” one wrote bitterly. “There is a straight line that can be drawn from that day to today, one of the darkest days in the history of democracy and self-governance. Would it have made a difference in the end? We can never know, but history will not judge us kindly.”
The documents and interviews with former employees make clear that Facebook has deep, highly precise knowledge about how its users are affected by what appears on its sites. Facebook relentlessly measures an astonishing array of data points, including the frequency, reach and sources of falsehoods and hateful content and often implements measures to suppress both.
Facebook keeps researching its own harms — and burying the findings
The company exhaustively studies potential policy changes for their impacts on user growth and other factors key to corporate profits, such as engagement, the extent of sharing and other reactions. Public relations and political impacts also are carefully weighed — to the point that potentially flattering and unflattering news headlines about the company are sketched out for review. The documents show that Facebook has declined to deploy some mitigation tactics when chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has objected on the basis that they will cause too many “false positives” or might stop people from engaging with its platforms.
The documents report, for example, that Facebook research, based on data from 2019, found that misinformation shared by politicians was more damaging than that coming from ordinary users. Yet the company maintained a policy that year that explicitly allowed political leaders to lie without facing the possibility of fact checks.
That same year, a report titled “Carol’s Journey to QAnon” examined how Facebook’s recommendation algorithms affected the feeds to an experimental account supposedly representing a conservative mother in North Carolina. The report found that rapid polarization was an entrenched feature in how the platform operated. The first QAnon page landed in the conservative user’s feed in just five days.
“The content in this account [followed primarily via various recommendation systems!] devolved to a quite troubling, polarizing state in an extremely short period of time,” concluded the research, which was among the documents Haugen shared with the SEC but had also been previously reported by Vice News. Still, Facebook allowed QAnon to operate on its site largely unchecked for another 13 months before its first attempted crack down, which proved so ineffective that the company imposed new sanctions two months later.
Company research also revealed in an undated document that XCheck — the “cross-check” program created to prevent “pr fires” by imposing an extra layer of oversight when the accounts of politicians and other users with large followings faced enforcement action — had devolved into a widely abused “white list” that effectively placed the powerful largely beyond the reach of company policies.
The internal analysis called the program a “breach of trust,” saying bluntly that the company did “not actually do what we say we do publicly.” But the report itself remained undisclosed until it was revealed by the Wall Street Journal last month. On Thursday, Facebook’s Oversight Board blasted the company for failing to disclose enough information for it to evaluate XCheck. In a statement, the board said, “Facebook admitted it should not have said that cross-check only applied to a ‘small number of decisions.’ ”
Even when Facebook deployed tools to prevent harm, its own studies found that those tools sometimes failed to operate as promised. After the company decided this year to stop recommending political groups entirely, according to the documents, a third of the listed civic and political groups continued to be seen by users over a period from just before the election through mid-January.
Stop the Steal, which became a rallying cry for those who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6, was particularly problematic, the documents reveal. Facebook moved quickly to ban the main Stop the Steal group — and publicly announced the move as one of its “exceptional measures” for “this period of heightened tension” — after determining that it was surging with hateful comments, white supremacy and incitements to violence. But other groups touting the slogan “stop the steal” began to experience “meteoric growth,” one internal document reported. The ranks of one such group were artificially bolstered by 137 “super inviters” who each had invited more than 500 people.
Inside the ‘shadow reality world’ promoting the lie that the presidential election was stolen
The report called the company’s response “piecemeal” as Facebook officials struggled to determine whether these new groups were a “coordinated effort to delegitimize the election” or were “protected free expression from users who were confused or afraid or deserved our empathy.”
The answer became obvious in hindsight, prompting an urgent internal effort “to learn what we can about the growth of the election delegitimizing movements that grew, spread conspiracy, and helped incite the Capitol insurrection.”
Facebook’s sprawling effort to protect the 2020 election was years in the making, with many measures given trial runs in the 2018 U.S. midterm congressional elections and also during votes in other countries, current and former employees say.
Facebook’s tool kit was extensive, including running banners and labels with authoritative information and measures such as dialing down the virality of problematic content through tweaks to the algorithms that determine what users see. Routine spreaders of false or hateful content, for example, might find their posts mysteriously reaching smaller audiences. Those seeking to suppress voter turnout might find themselves banned, company documents detailing these measures show.
Perspective: Twitter and Facebook warning labels aren’t enough to save democracy
Facebook also created a command center — initially called a “war room” when the idea debuted in 2018 — that was staffed around-the-clock to monitor and check abuses before they could spread widely.
This approach was shaped by the intense political backlash Facebook experienced after the discovery that Russian operatives had spread disinformation designed to polarize the American populace and help elect Trump in 2016. Scholars still debate how effective the Russian interference on Facebook was, but the ensuing scandal engulfed the company, prompting harsh congressional scrutiny and broad public anger.
The controversy, which continued for months, prompted public apologies by Zuckerberg and other Facebook officials, and, former employees say, it strengthened the hands of reformers within the company. They pushed for research to develop teams and tools that made Facebook better at controlling malevolent, misleading efforts by foreigners.
The payoff came on Election Day in November. Although some problems did persist — one internal report obtained separately by The Post said that nearly a quarter of Facebook users reported seeing hate speech ahead of the election and that more than half reported seeing content that made them wary of discussing political issues in public — close races in several states and questions about the national outcome made problems at Facebook, at worst, a subplot.
One former executive, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the overall goal of Facebook’s election strategy “was to make sure Facebook wasn’t the story.”
Many at the company felt that on that score, they had succeeded.
But problems began to arise immediately after the election, as Trump and his allies began touting false claims about his loss. In a Nov. 5 post on Workplace, an employee noted that the top comment appearing below a news story about coming vote counts included a link to a false news report. “Not only do we not do something about combustible election misinformation in comments, we amplify them and give them broader distribution,” the employee wrote.
A few weeks later the company began rolling back — as had always been planned — some unusually aggressive measures that had helped control toxic speech and misinformation on its platforms, although some others remained in place, officials say. In addition to outright bans and removals, these election-season measures had included what Facebook calls “soft actions” that quietly slowed the spread of problematic content but stopped short of outright bans or removals.
Those measures, detailed in company documents, included requiring administrators of groups that had a large number of strikes against them for violent or hateful content to review posts before they went up and freezing comments in those groups, reducing the number of invitations a group administrator could send from 100 to 30, and the triggering of a special set of algorithms that would automatically reduce the spread of content the software interpreted as possible hate speech.
Several measures also were aimed at groups and pages that, like the ones touting Stop the Steal, sought to “delegitimize” the 2020 election, according to a company document detailing such measures. One barred them from Facebook’s “recommendation engine.” Another prevented existing groups from changing their names to terms that undermined the election’s legitimacy. They blocked the algorithm’s ability to recommend live video on political topics.
Misinformation on Facebook got six times more clicks than factual news during the 2020 election, study says
As Facebook lifted these controls after the election, company leaders did one thing more that only a handful of insiders knew was coming: It dismantled the Civic Integrity group that included Haugen and others who had spent years working on combating dangerous content on Facebook.
Officials said their goal was to redistribute these roughly 200 employees across the company. But when Haugen and others heard the news, they were aghast. This was a company — as they knew better than most — that was notorious for its record of facilitating the warping of elections, incitements to political violence and the pushing of voters everywhere into self-reinforcing partisan bubbles.
Facebook’s vice president for integrity, Guy Rosen, wrote in a Dec. 2 note to his team: “We’ve made incredible progress in getting problems under control, and many of us looked to the US 2020 elections as a major milestone on this path. I’m so very proud of this team and everything we’ve accomplished.”
He then outlined a new organizational structure in which the responsibilities previously assigned to Civic Integrity were redistributed to several other teams. Rosen portrayed it in his note as a sign of Civic Integrity’s success and maturation. Those on the team and others familiar with internal deliberations at the company did not see it that way.
The issue, said people familiar with internal discussions at Facebook, was that Civic Integrity team members had grown too vocal, with a succession of them airing their concerns in posts on Workplace, visible in many cases to more than 60,000 employees worldwide. Many of these posts became fodder for unflattering news coverage.
“The leadership was not happy with how loud the Civic Integrity team was. They wanted to decentralize the team and the power they had,” said one former company official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. “The way they approached it, it didn’t feel like they were saying, ‘You guys did a great job; thank you for your service.’ It was like, ‘We’re going to split up the family.’”
But whatever public relations problems the Civic Integrity team was creating as an intact unit would become more serious as the company moved to dissolve the unit. Haugen and others began considering whether to speak out about what they had learned about their employer.
As Jan. 6 approached, Facebook began tracking a rise in toxic content on its platforms, according to former employees and a Facebook document that also listed potential “break the glass” measures that had been in place during the election but “previously rolled back.” Facebook officials say these measures had been lifted gradually into December, though some continued through February.
Just a few weeks later many Facebook employees watched, alarmed, as Trump made an incendiary speech to supporters gathered on the White House Ellipse. Soon they were filled with dread as rioters descended on the U.S. Capitol, said former employees, and it became clear that Stop the Steal was no mere Facebook group showing worrying signs of political extremism.
41 minutes of fear: A video timeline from inside the Capitol siege
As violence engulfed the Capitol, the policy team based in Washington as well as data scientists in the company’s integrity division began preparing for unprecedented measures against Trump, including what would become an initial 24-hour ban of the president. The Washington policy office, whose leadership ranks were dominated by Republicans, had, since Trump announced his candidacy in 2015, played a key role in adapting company rules for the Trump era — creating exceptions, for example, that allowed hate speech from a political leader so long as it was deemed “newsworthy.”
But his central role in inciting violence at the Capitol had become impossible to ignore, former employees said. Zuckerberg announced the temporary ban on Trump later that day.
Policymakers in the Washington office also worried that some of their friends might be trapped inside the Capitol, in personal danger while simply doing their highly political jobs. When Zuckerberg sent a companywide note expressing relief that no employee was at risk, several in the Washington office bristled. How did he know? They soon concluded that he did not, and could not, have known yet, said several people familiar with the incident.
Another top executive who became the target of employee discontent that day was Chief Technology Officer Mike Schroepfer, a well-liked executive seen as being close to Zuckerberg.
“I’m saddened [by] the attack on the most fundamental part of America: the peaceful transfer of power,” Schroepfer wrote on Workplace, apparently in response to a post from Zuckerberg calling Jan. 6 “a dark moment in our nation’s history.”
Schroepfer added, “Hang in there everyone as we figure out the best ways to support our teams and manage discourse on our platform to allow for peaceful discussion and organization but not calls for violence.”
That sentiment was met with rage.
“I’m struggling to match my values with my employment here,” wrote one employee on Workplace whose name was redacted in the copy shared with The Post. “I came here hoping to affect change and improve society, but all I’ve seen is atrophy and abdication of responsibility. I’m tired of platitudes; I want action items. We’re not a neutral entity.”
Another employee, whose name also was redacted from the documents, recalled the anger in June 2020, after Black Lives Matter protesters had been forcibly cleared from a park next to the White House before Trump walked through for a photo opportunity during which he denounced the demonstrations.
“Employees have been crying out for months to start treating high-level political figures the same way we treat each other on the platform. That’s all we’re asking for,” the employee wrote. “Last we spoke, innocent protesters were tear-gassed under the orders of a political figure whose message was amplified. Today, a coup was attempted against the United States. I hope circumstances aren’t even more dire next time we speak.”
Facebook finally took its most aggressive action yet the day after the Capitol attack, banning Trump “indefinitely” from the platform for inciting violence. The many exceptions Facebook had made to allow for the president’s rule-bending behavior had reached their limit.
But in the days after the insurrection, Facebook went out of its way to play down the company’s role in what happened on Jan. 6. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, appearing at a live event, made a point of saying that the events that day were largely organized on other platforms “that don’t have our abilities to stop hate.”
Sandberg’s comments struck some people within Facebook as tone-deaf, as if company leaders were attempting a victory lap in the wake of a historic tragedy.
“That was the last straw for me,” said one former executive, who quit shortly after Sandberg’s statement. “We didn’t know the full extent, but we knew it was disingenuous.”

The Facebook Papers are a set of internal documents that were provided to Congress in redacted form by Frances Haugen’s legal counsel. The redacted versions were reviewed by a consortium of news organizations, including The Washington Post.
The trove of documents show how Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has, at times, contradicted, downplayed or failed to disclose company findings on the impact of its products and platforms.
The documents also provided new details of the social media platform’s role in fomenting the storming of the U.S. Capitol. An investigation by ProPublica and The Washington Post found that Facebook groups swelled with at least 650,000 posts attacking the legitimacy of Joe Biden’s victory between Election Day and Jan. 6.
Facebook engineers gave extra value to emoji reactions, including ‘angry,’ pushing more emotional and provocative content into users’ news feeds.

Former President Donald Trump is displayed on a screen during a meeting of the Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol on Monday.
The House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol has released its final report to the public.
In more than 800 pages and over the course of eight chapters, the report details what led the panel to recommend four criminal referrals against former President Donald Trump.
The panel says that while the danger to the Capitol by an armed and angry crowd was foreseeable, the fact that a president would be the catalyst was unprecedented. 
""If we lacked the imagination to suppose that a President would incite an attack on his own Government, urging his supporters to 'fight like hell,' we lack that insight no more,"" the report says. The lawmakers add: 
""The best defense against that danger will not come from law enforcement, but from an informed and active citizenry.""
The lengthy introduction of the report was released on Monday, along with the announcement of criminal and ethical referrals. The full report, made public on Thursday night, includes additional evidence and citations for its conclusions.

President Trump arrives to speak to supporters from The Ellipse near the White House on Jan. 6, 2021. The rally later turned into a riot that breached the U.S. Capitol.
After roughly 18 months of investigations, the House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol has released their full report.
The document, which is more than 800 pages long, recommends the Justice Department pursue criminal charges against former President Donald Trump for his role in the attack. And they say Congress should act to bar Trump, and others involved in the Jan. 6 insurrection, from ever holding federal office again.
A summary of the full report was released Monday after the committee concluded its final public hearing. More documents are still expected to be released.
""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report.
Despite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him.
In addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.

                Members of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the U.S. Capitol hold its last public meeting on Capitol Hill on Monday.

Pro-Trump supporters attack the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. A House select committee has spent roughly a year and a half investigating what led to the riot and released its full report on Friday.
The report is broken into eight sections: the former president's election lies and declarations of victory, Trump's efforts to ""find"" additional votes, his pressure campaigns targeting federal and state officials to overturn the 2020 election results and the events of Jan. 6 itself.
Other key details in the report mirror the findings of the committee laid out in previous hearings that took place over the last year:
You can read more on NPR's coverage of the committee's public hearings here.
What will come of the committee's recommendations is unclear. While lawmakers made recommendations to the Department of Justice, it doesn't necessarily mean the department has to act.
In their report, the committee also referred four Republican House members — Kevin McCarthy of California, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Scott Perry of Pennsylvania and Andy Biggs of Arizona — to the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with subpoenas. But in the new year, Republicans will take control of the House of Representatives, which means it's possible that these four House members don't face any repercussions.
 But at least one point from the committee has taken hold already: an update to the Electoral Count Act, which Congress passed this week in connection to a major spending bill. The updated legislation further clarifies that the vice president's role in certifying the election is entirely ceremonial.

CARACAS, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition said on Wednesday it will hold a presidential primary on Oct. 22 to choose a candidate to face the ruling party in presidential elections tentatively scheduled for 2024.
The primary is the opposition's first since 2012. It hopes to rally supporters after years of futile attempts to unseat the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro, but it faces deep voter apathy, among other challenges.
The next move is for the 10-person opposition committee tasked with scheduling the vote to meet with the country's National Electoral Council, Jesus Maria Casal, the head of the council, told journalists. He did not give a date for when that would happen.
""We're going to demand voting centers... it's a question of rights,"" Casal said.
At least a dozen people from various opposition parties have said they will run in the primary, including some who are barred from participating in politics by judicial rulings the opposition considers undemocratic.
One of those barred is former state governor Henrique Capriles, who won the opposition's last primary over a decade ago, before losing the 2012 presidential vote to late former President Hugo Chavez.
Chavez's protege Maduro beat Capriles by a much-narrower margin in another vote in 2013.
The main coalition of opposition parties boycotted the 2018 presidential vote when Maduro won re-election, a victory which they and countries including the United States consider fraudulent.
Maduro, who is enjoying renewed relations with neighbors Colombia and Brazil and some loosened U.S. restrictions on the oil industry, has not yet set a date for the 2024 vote and has intimated it could be moved earlier.
The opposition, which has been repeatedly fractured by in-fighting, recently named a new three-person leadership for their parallel legislature, replacing the former interim government of Juan Guaido.

CARACAS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition election commission said on Monday it will move forward with its late October primary vote to pick its presidential candidate for next year's general election, after the country's national electoral council sought a delay.
The South American nation's beleaguered political opposition will face off against President Nicolas Maduro's ruling socialists, who have presided over a prolonged economic meltdown marked by sky-high inflation and persecution of critics, according to rights groups.
Maduro is expected to run for re-election, but has not yet made a formal announcement.
Last month, the National Electoral Council (CNE) - seen by the opposition as aligned with Maduro - responded to a June request to assist with the opposition's primary, saying it could provide voting centers and machines but stressing more time was needed to help organize the primary vote for later in November.
But most of the 13 opposition candidates rejected this request, preferring to keep the Oct. 22 primary, while criticizing what they called a slow CNE response.
The opposition commission - made up of eight lawyers and experts - said it had asked for up to 400 additional voting centers as well as security at the centers and help facilitating visas for electoral experts and foreign journalists covering the process.
In its own statement later on Monday, the CNE insisted it holds ""exclusive competency"" to organize elections but would provide technical support to the opposition ""to guarantee a reliable, transparent process"" that promotes participation and security.
The statement did not address the primary election's date.
Venezuela's opposition counts some 3,000 voting centers, according to commission president Jesus Maria Casal.
Some 14,000 Venezuelan schools typically serve as electoral centers for the country's 20 million voters, but since the primary is being carried out independently, these cannot be used without CNE authorization.
Venezuelan authorities have in recent months disqualified some opposition candidates, including former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado, the opposition's leading hopeful in polls.

CARACAS/WASHINGTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Venezuela's government and its political opposition on Tuesday agreed to electoral guarantees for 2024 presidential elections, paving the way for possible U.S. sanctions relief, though the deal did not lift bans on opposition candidates barred from public office.
The elections will take place in the second half of next year, and international observers - including from the European Union and United Nations - will oversee the vote, according to terms unveiled following a resumption of long-suspended talks.
Multiple sources had said ahead of Tuesday's announcement that the U.S. was prepared to ease some oil-related sanctions on OPEC member-nation Venezuela if Washington was satisfied President Nicolas Maduro had given enough ground to the opposition.
President Joe Biden's administration had said it would lift some long-standing punitive measures in exchange for democratic concessions from Maduro.
But as the White House studied the details of the agreement finalized in Barbados, it was unclear how soon the U.S. might act or how far it could go with sanctions relief.
""We welcome the Venezuelan-led political agreement reached today in Barbados,"" according to a joint statement from the U.S., EU, Britain and Canada, calling it a necessary step toward the ""restoration of democracy in Venezuela.""
However, the statement also reiterated calls for release of political prisoners, independence of the electoral process, freedom of expression and respect for human rights, issues that were not covered in Tuesday's agreement.
Reuters reported last week that Venezuela and the U.S. had progressed at their own talks in Qatar toward a deal that could allow at least one additional foreign oil firm to take Venezuelan crude oil for debt repayment if Maduro resumed negotiations with the opposition.
Any significant alleviation of oil sanctions would mark a further shift by the Biden administration away from former President Donald Trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign against the socialist-led South American country.
But U.S. sources have said any U.S. policy changes would be reversible if Maduro failed to meet his election commitments. Oil revenues are crucial to Venezuela's crippled economy.
Tuesday's meeting in Barbados, brokered by Norway, was the first between the two sides in 11 months.
The talks, meant to provide a way out of Venezuela's long-running political and economic crisis, will continue at an unspecified date, the parties said, adding they are committed to respecting the results of the vote.
The deal says each side can choose its 2024 candidate according to its internal rules, but did not reverse bans on some opposition figures - including Oct. 22 primary frontrunner Maria Corina Machado - that prevent them from holding office.
The opposition has said the bans, handed down by the controller general, are unlawful and Washington has rejected any roadblocks to opposition candidates.
""If you have an administrative inhabilitation...from the controller general of the republic you cannot be a candidate, I want to clarify that,"" Jorge Rodriguez, the head of the government delegation told a press conference after the signing.
Speaking before Rodriguez, the head of the opposition delegation Gerardo Blyde had said the deal could allow banned candidates to ""recover their rights.""
The opposition has shied away from laying out what could happen if Machado were to win the primary but could not register for the general election.
It remains unclear whether the often-fractious opposition would accept her choosing another candidate to run in her stead.
At least two candidates who initially had been set to run in the primary have bowed out because they are banned.
Maduro, president since 2013, is expected to run for re-election but has not yet formalized his candidacy.
The U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela to punish Maduro's government following a 2018 election that Washington considered a sham. Since 2019, U.S. sanctions have banned PDVSA from exporting its oil to its chosen markets.
The other accord signed by the two sides includes an agreement to protect Houston-based oil refiner Citgo Petroleum, whose parent company's shares will be put for auction starting this month through a court-organized process to pay creditors.

CARACAS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition will hold a primary on Sunday to pick its candidate for 2024 presidential elections, despite the front-runner being barred from holding office. President Nicolas Maduro is expected to seek another term.
The primary is the first the opposition has held in 11 years. It has not backed a presidential candidate in a general election since 2013.
The government and the opposition said in a joint agreement signed on Tuesday that each side can choose its candidate according to its own internal rules.
The primary could be a chance for the opposition to rally support from voters in Venezuela, whose economy has been in deep crisis for years.
The U.S. has long said it would lift some of its sanctions on Maduro's government in exchange for democratic concessions from the president. Sources this week said Washington would consider some relief in response to Tuesday's deal.
Opposition politicians have organized the primary without state assistance after the National Electoral Council took months to respond to a request for logistical help.
Officials who are found guilty of corruption are banned from holding public office for up to 15 years.
Venezuela's opposition says the government uses bans unlawfully to prevent them from competing in elections.
Maria Corina Machado, who is expected to win the primary, has been barred from holding public office since June, because she supported U.S. sanctions on the Maduro government and backed former opposition leader Juan Guaido.
Two other candidates, of the thirteen originally registered for the primary, have dropped out because of their own bans.
The deal on Tuesday did not include lifting of the bans, with the head of the government delegation saying those with administrative sanctions cannot participate in the election.
It is unclear what will happen if a disqualified candidate wins.
Machado has said if she is the victor, she could put pressure on the electoral council to let her register for the general election.
Others have argued a succession mechanism to replace her would be necessary, and several candidates have said there is no unified decision about what to do.
It remains unclear whether the often-fractious opposition would accept Machado choosing someone else to run in her place.
Tuesday's deal between the opposition and the government said the vote will happen in the latter half of 2024, but gave no specific date.
Venezuela's elections traditionally take place in December, though in 2018 voting was brought forward to May.

© 2023 Reuters. All rights reserved","(2023, 10, 18)","Oct 18, 2023 ... CARACAS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition will hold a primary on Sunday to pick its candidate for 2024 presidential elections, ..."
66761,38377,"WASHINGTON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Wednesday broadly eased sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector in response to a deal reached between the government and opposition parties for the 2024 election - the most extensive rollback of Trump-era restrictions on Caracas.
A new general license issued by the U.S. Treasury Department authorized OPEC member Venezuela, which had been under crushing sanctions since 2019, to produce and export oil to its chosen markets for the next six months without limitation.
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed President Nicolas Maduro's electoral concessions but said Washington has given him until the end of November to begin lifting bans on opposition presidential candidates and start releasing political prisoners and ""wrongfully detained"" Americans.
A senior State Department official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, threatened to reverse sanctions relief measures unless Maduro takes such action.
The U.S. moves follow months of negotiations in which Washington had pressed Caracas for concrete actions toward democratic elections in return for lifting some - but not all - of the tough sanctions imposed under former U.S. President Donald Trump.
It also represents a significant step in the increased engagement of President Joe Biden's administration with Maduro on issues ranging from energy to migration, a shift from Trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign against the socialist government.
Venezuela ruling party official Jorge Rodriguez, who leads the government's negotiating team at talks with the opposition, said on state television later on Wednesday that the sanctions relief affected all oil activities.
""The possibility of any person or company coming to Venezuela to invest is totally open,"" he said.
Maduro's government and the opposition reached an agreement in Barbados on Tuesday on electoral guarantees for an internationally monitored vote to be held in the second half of 2024. But the deal stopped short of Maduro agreeing to reinstate opposition candidates who had been barred from public office.
Blinken said in a statement that the U.S. was acting ""consistent with our longstanding commitment to provide U.S. sanctions relief in response to concrete steps toward competitive elections and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.""
Wednesday's announcements alleviated some of the toughest sanctions that Venezuela has faced but it left in place a number of other restrictions.

Even so, the U.S. measures could reopen Venezuela's doors to dozens of oil companies with frozen or reduced operations in Venezuela.
The U.S. imposed harsh sanctions on Venezuela to punish Maduro's government following his 2018 re-election, which the U.S. and other Western governments rejected as a sham. Since 2019, U.S. sanctions have banned state-run oil company PDVSA from exporting to its chosen markets.
The changes announced on Wednesday include the issuance of a six-month general license allowing the production, sale and export of Venezuela's crude and gas, without limitations on customers or destinations, and another general license authorizing dealings with Minerven – the Venezuelan state-owned gold mining company.
The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement, however, that it was prepared to revoke those authorizations at any time if representatives of Maduro fail to follow through on their commitments in the deal with the opposition.
Treasury also removed the secondary trading ban on certain Venezuelan sovereign bonds and state-run oil company PDVSA debt and equity, though a ban on trading in the primary Venezuelan bond market remains in place, it said.
The U.S. has been seeking ways to boost global flows of oil to alleviate high prices caused by sanctions on Russia and OPEC+ decisions to reduce output.
But the chances Venezuela's exports could offset those cuts are slim absent a big increase in investment in the country's crippled oil sector, oil industry experts said.
Two decades of mismanagement and insufficient investment, coupled with U.S. oil sanctions since 2019, are expected to stymie state-run PDVSA's ability to make a quick comeback to cash-paying oil markets and offer its crude at fair prices.
Talks between the government and the opposition, meant to provide a way out of Venezuela's long-running political and economic crisis, were held on Tuesday for the first time in nearly a year. They agreed to further meetings at an unspecified date.
The deal they announced said each side can choose its 2024 candidate according to its internal rules but did not reverse bans on some opposition figures - including Oct. 22 primary frontrunner Maria Corina Machado - that prevent them from holding office.
Opposition sources said they have not given up on trying to get those bans lifted.

CARACAS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado is leading the vote count in the Venezuelan opposition's presidential primary by a huge margin and has claimed victory in the Sunday contest, with final results pending.
The vote to choose a unity opposition candidate to face President Nicolas Maduro in his probable re-election bid next year came amid pledges by the United States to roll back sanctions relief if the government fails to lift bans preventing some opposition figures from holding office.
Machado was tallying 93% of the vote, with just over 26% of ballot boxes counted, the primary's organizing commission said around midnight.
""From tonight we begin a great movement for a great national alliance for the transformation of Venezuela,"" Machado said at her campaign headquarters.
""Today I received a mandate and I accept with Venezuelans the commitment of making that mandate matter.""
The count - delayed by a server blockage - was expected to resume later on Monday. It was unclear when the next results update would be given.
Machado's nearest rival, former lawmaker Carlos Prosperi, had 4.75% of the vote.
Participation in the vote, organized without state help, was more than double what had been expected in some states. Venezuela has about 20 million eligible voters.
Polling places - including in private homes and on street corners - were meant to close at 4 p.m. (2000 GMT), but many remained opened hours later, so those waiting in long lines could vote or so additional ballots could be delivered.
Some of the estimated 3,000 polling locations nationwide had to be moved, according to human rights groups and voters, causing confusion.
Voters also faced transportation problems. Gasoline availability was limited in border states Tachira and Bolivar and public transport in the country's interior was working irregularly, according to Reuters witnesses.
""On Friday we waited in three lines to be able to get gasoline for today and we couldn't,"" said housewife Melissa Diaz, 39, who arrived at her polling place in eastern Guyana City with a nearly empty tank.
""We've lost a whole day, but even if we had to walk or cycle, we were coming to vote.""
Machado, 56, an industrial engineer, has led her rivals by some 40 points in polls.
But Machado, like two former rivals who dropped out of the race, is barred from public office over her support of the sanctions on Maduro's government and would not be able to register for the general election.
The opposition and government this week signed a deal on some election guarantees, including the presence of international observers. The accord allows each side to choose its candidate according to internal rules, but did not retract the election disqualifications.
The United States, which broadly eased Trump-era sanctions on Venezuelan oil and gas and bonds in response to the deal, has said Maduro has until the end of November to begin rescinding the bans and releasing political prisoners and ""wrongfully detained"" Americans.
Though five people were released, lead government negotiator Jorge Rodriguez confirmed this week that those with disqualifications cannot run in the 2024 contest, set for the second half of the year.
Some in the opposition have said they are skeptical Maduro will follow through on the deal.
The opposition, which says the disqualifications are unlawful, has been reticent to say what it would do if Machado wins the primary but is unable to compete in 2024.
Machado - who says her goal is to remove Maduro in a fair and peaceful vote - has said she would pressure the electoral authorities to let her register. Maduro has not announced that he will seek re-election, but many observers expect him to run.
Others have argued selecting a substitute candidate would be necessary, although whether the often-fractious opposition would accept Machado choosing a replacement remains to be seen.
Ten candidates are competing in the primary, where candidates have pledged to come up with solutions for the country's long economic crisis.
""If you buy diapers you don't buy food, so I buy food and not diapers,"" said 20-year-old hairdresser Rosimar Gonzalez, who voted in central Maracay with her young son in her arms.
""We have to change presidents.""
About 4 million of the 7.7 million Venezuelans migrants who have left their country are estimated to be of voting age and are able to vote at centers in 28 countries.
""I came to vote because I want to hug my grandchildren again, because I want to see my country on the road to freedom before I go,"" said a teary Armando Cedeno, 100, who voted in the afternoon in Maracaibo.
""I am confident that God will give me that gift.""
(This story has been corrected to say the vote count will resume on Monday in paragraph 6)

CARACAS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado was formally declared the victor of the Venezuelan opposition's weekend presidential primary on Thursday, as a government official warned foreign diplomats not to interfere in the electoral process.
The country's attorney general said on Wednesday his office has launched a criminal investigation into the primary and members of its organizing commission.
The investigation risks the wrath of the U.S., which last week relaxed some sanctions on the government of President Nicolas Maduro on pledges his government made of a fair election next year, in a deal between it and the opposition in Barbados.
The U.S. State Department has already said it will reinstate previous sanctions if Maduro's government does not rescind public office bans on Machado and others, as well as release political prisoners and ""wrongly detained"" Americans by the end of November.
Sanctions were widely expanded in 2019 after Maduro won re-election in what the U.S. and others say was a fraudulent vote.
Machado, who won about 93% of votes in the primary, met with about 10 foreign diplomats on Wednesday at her party's headquarters, sparking the government's objections.
""With all due respect...don't interfere with internal issues,"" Jorge Rodriguez, president of the ruling party-run legislature, told a large group of diplomats at his own meeting with them on Thursday, as reporters looked on.
The government did not provide a list of attendees at the meeting.
Rodriguez, the government's top negotiator in talks with the opposition, told the diplomats the primary violated electoral rules because it was organized without the help of electoral authorities and violated the Barbados deal.
Machado, however, said the investigation into the primary is a ""clear"" violation of the Barbados deal.
""We hope it does not proceed,"" she said at a press conference to announce the primary's final vote count.
The primary's organizing commission tried unsuccessfully to involve electoral authorities, said commission head Jesus Maria Casal, who is among those under investigation.
He did not comment on the investigation.

CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela’s high court on Monday suspended the opposition’s entire primary election process, including its result, in the latest challenge by the government of President Nicolás Maduro to its adversaries ahead of the 2024 presidential vote.
The court ruled the opposition’s Oct. 22 contest may be in violation of the law. It was not immediately clear whether the suspension would effectively result in the nullification of the primary vote.
The Associated Press could not immediately seek clarification from the head of the National Primary Commission as he entered the attorney general’s office minutes after the ruling was issued. The commission is an independent body that formed to organize the opposition’s primary.

Maduro and his allies have ridiculed and minimized the primary all year, but they escalated their attacks after the election exceeded participation expectations. More than 2.4 million Venezuelans in the country and abroad voted, including in areas once considered strongholds of the ruling party.
“All effects of the different phases of the electoral process conducted by the National Primary Commission are suspended,” the ruling said.
The court ordered organizers to hand over all ballots, tally sheets and other documents, under the argument that the independent contest may be in violation of the law.
It also ratified the bans imposed by Maduro’s government on three candidates, including winner María Corina Machado, on running for office.
Machado, a former lawmaker and longtime government foe, was officially declared the primary’s winner Thursday after earning more than 90 percent of the vote.

66761,59886,"CARACAS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Venezuela's Supreme Justice Tribunal said on Monday it has suspended the results of an opposition presidential primary that took place this month, despite an electoral deal between the government and the opposition that allows each side to choose its candidate.
The ruling could risk the wrath of the United States, which this month rolled back some oil and gas industry and bond trading sanctions in exchange for the electoral deal.
The U.S. State Department has already said it will reinstate sanctions if the government of President Nicolas Maduro does not lift bans on some opposition candidates and free political prisoners and ""wrongfully detained"" Americans by the end of November.
The decision by the court, which the opposition considers an arm of the government, comes after the attorney general announced last week that his office is investigating the primary and members of its organizing commission for electoral violations, financial crimes and conspiracy.
Members of the organizing commission were meeting with prosecutors on Monday for interviews related to the case, the commission said on social media.
The opposition and the primary's winner Maria Corina Machado have insisted repeatedly the Oct. 22 vote was transparent and fair.
The government has decried alleged fraud since the day of the vote, which was organized without state help and which attracted more than 2.3 million voters.
The government of Maduro, in power for a decade, and the opposition signed an electoral deal in Barbados, agreeing to international observers and that each side can choose its candidate according to internal rules.

""We urge Nicolas Maduro and his representatives to uphold the commitments they made at the signing of the political roadmap agreement,"" a State Department spokesperson said. ""The U.S. government will take action if Maduro and his representatives do not meet their commitments.""
Both the investigation and the ruling come at the request of lawmaker Jose Brito, who the court said wanted to participate in the primary.
Brito does not belong to any of the parties that took part.
""Following the request of preventative protection and in consequence, all the effects of the distinct phases of the electoral process conducted by the National Primary Commission are suspended,"" the tribunal said on its website.
The commission must present all documents related to its creation, candidate registration, voting records and other documents, the tribunal said.
The commission must also account for the participation of candidates like Machado, who is barred from holding public office in a decision the opposition says is illegal.
The ruling ""temporarily suspends the primary until there is a final decision from the tribunal,"" said lawyer and university professor Jose Vicente Haro. ""The tribunal is late to the decision because it comes after the primary. They shouldn't have accepted the petition.""
Some observers said the opposition parties that participated in the primary should simply recognize Machado once again as their unity candidate, making any ruling on the contest moot.
The opposition this month declined electoral authorities' offer of help organize the primary, and its request to delay the vote until November, after the authorities took several months to respond to the opposition's request for assistance.

On Jan. 6, 2021, supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol, injuring scores of law enforcement officers, forcing a panicked evacuation of the nation's political leaders, and threatening the peaceful transfer of power.
Five people died during or soon after the riot, and more than $2.9 million worth of damage was done to the Capitol and grounds. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has estimated that 2,000 people may have been involved that day, and considers the attack an act of domestic terrorism. In response, the Department of Justice launched the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history.
NPR is tracking every criminal case stemming from that day's events. This database makes publicly available — and searchable — information on hundreds of cases, including alleged affiliation with extremist ideologies and past or present police or military experience.

Rep. Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol, talks to reporters on Nov. 17, 2022.
Rep. Bennie Thompson, chairman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, told reporters Tuesday the panel is likely to make criminal referrals.
""What we've decided is that we will probably make referrals – as to how many, we've not decided on the number,"" he said.
Thompson added: ""We have not made a decision as to who, but we have made decisions that criminal referrals will happen.""
Asked whether there is a list of people the panel is considering for referrals, Thompson said, ""Yes, but I can't give them to you right now.""
The committee is meeting virtually Tuesday evening to continue discussions on potential criminal referrals. They met on Friday morning behind closed doors to consider a range of topics — including whether to issue potential criminal referrals for former President Trump and others. 
The panel is expected to meet throughout this week and could share its plans on criminal referrals by Friday, Thompson said.
Trump, the central player in the panel's investigation into the violence that erupted on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, was subpoenaed by the panel in October. Trump has not cooperated. 
The committee has held a series of public hearings laying out its findings and is expected to present a comprehensive report before the end of the month.
Thompson called the report a ""work in progress."" 
""We're actually going over printed material now, scrubbing stuff,"" he said, noting the report is ""quite lengthy"" at eight chapters long.
The report is expected to include information that hasn't been made public during the previous hearings and the committee also plans to share hundreds of transcripts of the over 1,000 witnesses it interviewed.
Thompson said the final report will likely be introduced in ""some public format,"" but wouldn't speculate on whether it would take the form of another public committee hearing. 
The committee is set to sunset Dec. 31.

      The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack is weighing criminal referrals for former President Donald Trump and a number of his closest allies, multiple sources tell CNN.
  

      The sources would not elaborate on who besides Trump is being considered. 
  

      Criminal referrals would largely be symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes as it has its own criminal investigations into the Capitol attack ongoing.
  

      Committee members see criminal referrals as a critical part of their work, putting their views on the record in order to complete their investigation – not as a way to pressure DOJ, one of the sources told CNN. 
  

      “The committee wants to make sure nothing falls between the cracks and make an emphatic statement who it has identified as key organizers,” of the insurrection, a separate source said. 
  

      Committee members met Tuesday evening to further discuss criminal referrals, but sources say they don’t expect the panel to release the names of who would be subject to a criminal referral at this point.
  

January 6 committee member says entirety of panel's work will be released in coming weeks


      Members still need to vote on the final list of criminal referrals, which sources say still is not finalized.
  

      The committee’s chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, told reporters earlier Tuesday that the panel has decided to make criminal referrals to the Department of Justice but had not narrowed down the universe of individuals who may be referred.
  

      Asked whether Thompson believed any witnesses perjured themselves, he said, “that’s part of the discussion.”
  

      When the panel makes referrals, Thompson said it will be a separate document from the panel’s final report that will be sent to DOJ. 
  

      The committee is aiming to release its final report and vote publicly on criminal referrals on December 21, Thompson told reporters Wednesday. “There will be some form of public presentation. We haven’t decided exactly what that would be,” he said.
  

      A select committee spokesperson confirmed to CNN that criminal referrals will be “considered as a final part” of the panel’s work.
  

      “The Committee has determined that referrals to outside entities should be considered as a final part of its work. The committee will make decisions about specifics in the days ahead,” the spokesperson said.
  

      A source also told CNN on Tuesday that the criminal referrals the January 6 committee will ultimately be making “will be focused on the main organizers and leaders of the attacks.”
  

      A subcommittee of members was tasked with providing options to the full committee about how to present evidence of possible obstruction, possible perjury and possible witness tampering as well as potential criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, according to multiple sources familiar with the committee’s work.
  

      Democratic Reps. Jamie Raskin, Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren, and GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the panel, all trained lawyers, comprise this subcommittee. 
  

      Raskin told CNN on Wednesday that everything is “still on track” but no decisions have been made following the Tuesday meeting as the committee works through where to “draw the line” when it comes to referrals because there is such a “broad universe” of potential offenses and offenders.
  

MAGA-world keeps losing in its efforts to tie up Trump criminal probes in court 


      Committee members are on the same page, broadly speaking, Raskin told CNN, but a decision on who they ultimately refer to the Justice Department for prosecution – and for what offenses – is still a work in progress.
  

      But Schiff told CNN there is a “consensus among the members” regarding the referrals and that members are taking a unified approach on that front.
  

      The decision of whether to issue criminal referrals has loomed large over the committee. Members on the panel have been in wide agreement that Trump and some of his closest allies have committed a crime when he pushed a conspiracy to prevent the peaceful transfer of power, as they’ve laid out in their hearings. But they have long been split over what to do about it, including whether to make a criminal referral of Trump to the Justice Department.
  

      In the past, the question has led to a vigorous, at times contentious, debate among committee members, sources have said. Those who previously said criminal referrals are not necessary to close out the panel’s investigation say the committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and that the Justice Department does not need Congress to investigate crimes as it has its own criminal investigations into the Capitol attack that are ongoing.
  

      Still, the idea of a criminal referral of Trump, even if entirely symbolic in nature, has hung like a shadow over the panel since it was first formed, and many members felt it was a necessary measure in order to complete its work.
  

This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Wednesday.

WASHINGTON — The House Jan. 6 committee met Sunday to finalize its plans to issue at least three criminal referrals for former President Donald Trump, NBC News has learned exclusively.
The committee, gathering publicly Monday, is expected to vote on referrals asking the Justice Department to pursue at least three criminal charges against Trump related to the Capitol riot: obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the government and inciting or assisting an insurrection.
Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said in part during the meeting overheard by NBC News that he believed referrals were “warranted.” A source familiar with the committee’s plans told NBC News about the meeting and its location in the Capitol complex. 
The committee did not respond to requests for comment. 
NBC News previously reported that obstruction, conspiracy and incitement of an insurrection were among the charges the committee was considering to recommend against Trump.
The criminal referrals carry no official legal weight, and it remains up to the Justice Department to decide whether or not to charge Trump and anyone else the committee might refer.
Sources confirmed after the meeting that the discussions in the room were a review of decisions the committee made previously that would be presented Monday and that the meeting served as a rehearsal of sorts.
The committee also discussed John Eastman, a conservative lawyer on Trump's legal team who authored a memo outlining a theory of how Trump could hold on to power on Jan. 6.
Eastman, via his attorney, declined to comment.
The committee also plans to refer several Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee for their defiance of congressional subpoenas, NBC News has learned.
“None of the subpoenaed members complied,” Raskin said during Sunday’s meetings, presenting the findings of the subcommittee responsible for referrals. “And we are now referring four members of Congress for appropriate sanction with the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply.”
Asked for comment, a Trump campaign spokesperson shared a statement from Friday attacking the committee, adding that the campaign will have more to say after the referrals are made public Monday.
The bipartisan committee, which is winding down its work before the end of the year, has rushed to file its findings into a lengthy, eight-chapter report set to be released to the public Wednesday.

WASHINGTON — The House Jan. 6 committee voted Monday to recommend that the Justice Department pursue a batch of criminal charges against former President Donald Trump for his role in an effort to overturn the 2020 election and the fomenting of a deadly mob at the Capitol.
Trump was the first president in American history to be impeached twice. Now, he is also the first president to be formally referred by Congress for potential prosecution.
The committee's final meeting was the culmination of a sweeping 17-month congressional investigation that included more than 100 subpoenas, interviews with more than 1,200 witnesses and the collection of hundreds of thousands of documents. 
The select committee also took aim at Trump’s top allies — on and off Capitol Hill — who worked with the former president to block certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory and illegitimately keep Trump in power.
“We understand the gravity of each and every referral we are making today, just as we understand the magnitude of the crime against democracy that we describe in our report,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who led the Jan. 6 subcommittee that examined referrals. “But we have gone where the facts and the law lead us, and inescapably they lead us here.” 
The Jan. 6 panel also issued a criminal referral to the Department of Justice for conservative attorney John Eastman, who the committee says was the architect of the scheme to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject states’ electoral votes on Jan. 6 and have fake electors submitted to the Congress instead. 
And it referred four Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee for defying subpoenas from the committee earlier this year, including House Minority Leader and potential incoming Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. The others are: Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who is expected to be the next chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and Scott Perry, R-Pa. 
Raskin said there may be others worthy of prosecution and there may be other statutes that Trump violated, noting the Justice Department will be able to form ""a far more complete picture"" through its own ongoing investigation. 
Pressed why Trump and Eastman were the only ones formally referred to DOJ, Raskin told reporters there was an internal debate within the committee about the scope of the referrals. While the committee found that other Trump associates — including Mark Meadows, Rudy Giuliani and Jeffrey Clark — were “actors” in the plot to overturn the election, Raskin said, investigators were “stymied” because some individuals chose not to cooperate with the Jan. 6 panel.  
“We focused on the masterminds and the ring-leaders, and we trust that the Department of Justice will do its job, as they’ve been doing,” Raskin said after the meeting.
The committee is wrapping up its work before it disbands at the end of the year. But Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said the nation finds itself ""in strange and uncharted waters."" 
""We’ve never had a president of the United States stir up a violent attempt to block the transfer of power,” he said. “If we are to survive as a nation of laws and democracy, this can never happen again.”
The Jan. 6 committee is urging DOJ to consider a number of charges against Trump, including conspiracy to defraud the federal government; obstruction of an official proceeding, in this case Congress’ certification of electoral votes; conspiracy to make a false statement; and inciting or assisting those in an insurrection.
The criminal referrals do not carry any legal weight but represent a symbolic rebuke of Trump, who remains the most influential Republican in the country and has launched another bid for president. 
Jack Smith, the independent special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, is already investigating Trump on numerous fronts, including for his role in the Jan. 6 riot.
Responding to the criminal referral, Eastman said the Jan. 6 panel had failed to address gaps in Capitol security and the electoral system and instead chose to focus on a “pretend” criminal case.  
“A criminal ‘referral’ from a congressional committee is not binding on the Department of Justice and carries no more legal weight than a ‘referral’ from any American citizen,"" Eastman said in a statement. “In fact, a ‘referral’ from the January 6th committee should carry a great deal less weight due to the absurdly partisan nature of the process that produced it.”
The committee used its final hearing to summarize the key investigatory threads from its nine previous hearings and to stitch them together into a case against Trump. 
“At the heart of our republic is the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power. ... Every President in our history has accepted this peaceful transfer of power — except one,” the committee's vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said of Trump.
Cheney said that ""among the most shameful"" findings of the committee was that Trump sat in the White House watching the violence unfold on TV on Jan. 6, but did nothing, even as advisers and allies begged him to call off the rioters.
""This was an utter moral failure,"" Cheney said of Trump's inaction. ""No man who would behave that way, at that moment in time, can ever serve in any position of authority in our nation again. He is unfit for any office.""
Witnesses, most of them Republicans, testified to the Jan. 6 panel that Trump and his inner circle had furiously worked to sow doubt about Biden’s legitimate election victory. 
They testified that Trump launched a multipronged campaign to pressure state officials, senior Justice Department officials and Vice President Mike Pence to help overturn the election.
They said Trump directed a mob of thousands of his supporters to march on the Capitol to disrupt lawmakers from certifying the results of the election. 
And the witnesses, which included many former Trump White House aides, said he refused to call off his supporters as they brutally assaulted police officers and stormed the halls of Congress while chanting threats to ""hang Mike Pence"" and target lawmakers by name. 
Trump recently used his Truth Social platform to slam the Jan. 6 investigators as ""corrupt cowards who hate this country.” The House impeached him for his role in the attack, but he was acquitted by the Senate. 
The committee on Monday also voted to formally adopt its full report on its Jan. 6 investigation, which kicked off in July 2021. It is expected to be hundreds of pages long and will be released to the public on Wednesday. Interview transcripts and other written and video evidence will also be shared with the public, committee members said.
“With painstaking detail, this executive summary documents the sinister plot to subvert the Congress, shred the Constitution and halt the peaceful transfer of power. The Committee has reached important conclusions about the evidence it has developed, and I respect those findings,"" said outgoing Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was targeted during the attack and who created the Jan. 6 committee. 
Like past reports on the John F. Kennedy assassination and the 9/11 terrorist attack, the Jan. 6 report will be zipped off to numerous book publishers and is expected to become an instant best seller.
But Thompson said his committee's report will be different in one significant way: It will be released first digitally, which will allow the panel to link to evidence that can provide the public with greater context.
""Whereas other reports have just been a bunch of pages, we think the digital part will add another dimension to it,"" Thompson told reporters.
During the hearing, Thompson also spoke directly to the American people, saying they will now decide on accountability for Trump’s actions as he seeks the White House again.
“The future of our democracy rests in your hands,” the Jan. 6 Committee chairman said during the hearing. “It’s up to the people of this country to decide who deserves the public trust. Who will put fidelity to the Constitution and democracy above all else. Who will abide by the rule of law, no matter the outcome.”

The Jan. 6 select House committee in a unanimous vote Monday referred former President Donald Trump to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation and potential prosecution for his efforts to overturn his loss in the 2020 election.
The committee's historic referral says there is sufficient evidence to refer Trump for four crimes: obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the government, making knowingly and willfully materially false statements to the federal government, and inciting or assisting an insurrection.
""We propose to the committee advancing referrals where the gravity of the specific offense, the severity of its actual harm, and the centrality of the offender to the overall design of the unlawful scheme to overthrow the election, compel us to speak,"" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., as he addressed his fellow panel members.
""Ours is not a system of justice where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass,"" Raskin said.
While the Justice Department, which is already conducting an investigation of Trump, takes criminal referrals seriously, it is not obligated to charge anyone with a crime.
However, the House panel's referral underscores how seriously the committee views Trump's actions after the election, in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, invasion of the halls of Congress by a mob of his supporters.
The nine-member panel is composed of seven Democrats and two Republicans, Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. Cheney was defeated in the GOP primary earlier this year, losing to Rep.-elect Harriet Hageman, while Kinzinger did not seek reelection this year.
Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing, has not been charged with any crimes related to the 2020 election and the attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Five people died as an immediate result of the riot, one of them a Capitol Police officer, Brian Sicknick. Nearly 140 other Capitol and Washington, D.C., police officers were injured in the attack, and several cops took their own lives on the heels of the riot.
If Trump were to be charged with and convicted of insurrection, he theoretically could be barred from holding federal office again under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Trump last month announced that he will seek the Republican nomination for president in 2024.
The committee on Monday also recommended that the DOJ investigate and potentially prosecute Trump's election law attorney John Eastman for his role in advancing a plan to overturn the election results. Eastman's referral was for his alleged violation of two criminal statutes: impeding an official proceeding of the United States government, and conspiring to defraud the United States.
Eastman was the author of a two-page memo that outlined a plan for then-Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify several states' Electoral College electors when Congress met for that purpose on Jan. 6.
Raskin said the committee would refer four members of Congress ""for appropriate sanction by the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with lawful subpoenas."" He did not name them, but House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is among the members who defied a subpoena from the committee.
As it made its referrals, the committee released a 154-page executive summary of its investigation.
The committee's actions Monday come after nearly 18 months of investigation, which included more than 1,200 witness interviews, the examination of hundreds of thousands of documents, the issuance of more than 100 subpoenas, and public hearings.
The DOJ already is conducting a criminal probe of Trump for his actions after the election, which involved an effort to reverse his losses to President Joe Biden in several swing states and to pressure Pence to refuse to accept Congress' certification of Biden's victory in the Electoral College.
The DOJ also is separately investigating him for his removal of government documents from the White House when he left office in January 2021.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in a statement Monday lauded the committee's work.
""With painstaking detail, this executive summary documents the sinister plot to subvert the Congress, shred the Constitution and halt the peaceful transfer of power,"" Pelosi said, adding that she respects the panel's findings.
""Our Founders made clear that, in the United States of America, no one is above the law,"" Pelosi said. ""This bedrock principle remains unequivocally true, and justice must be done.""
Jack Smith, who was appointed special counsel for the DOJ last month to handle its investigations of Trump, said at the time of that appointment, ""I intend to conduct the assigned investigations, and any prosecutions that may result from them, independently and in the best traditions of the Department of Justice.""
Smith added at that time: ""The pace of the investigations will not pause or flag under my watch. I will exercise independent judgement and will move the investigations forward expeditiously and thoroughly to whatever outcome the facts and the law dictate.""
Trump has called the investigations into his conduct after the 2020 election ""witch hunts"" and defended his actions as legitimate.
He continues to falsely claim he won the election and that Biden's victory was the result of widespread voter fraud in the swing states he lost.
Trump also has claimed that Pence had the authority to reject the Electoral College votes of those contested swing states. However, Pence concluded he did not have that power, a conclusion that is backed by a wide array of constitutional scholars and others.
A Trump spokesman over the weekend told NBC News in a statement, ""The January 6th un-Select Committee held show trials by Never Trump partisans who are a stain on this country's history.""
""This Kangaroo court has been nothing more than a vanity project that insults Americans' intelligence and makes a mockery of our democracy,"" the spokesman said.

In sweeping language, the committee’s executive summary warned that a failure to hold Trump and other election deniers accountable for their actions and statements since the 2020 election — including the former president’s recent call to terminate the Constitution — would threaten the “security and viability” of the republic itself.
“In the Committee’s judgment, based on all the evidence developed, President Trump believed then, and continues to believe now, that he is above the law, not bound by our Constitution and its explicit checks on Presidential authority,” the summary says.
“If President Trump and the associates who assisted him in an effort to overturn the lawful outcome of the 2020 election are not ultimately held accountable under the law, their behavior may become a precedent and invitation to danger for future elections,"" the committee continued. ""A failure to hold them accountable now may ultimately lead to future unlawful efforts to overturn our elections, thereby threatening the security and viability of our Republic.""
Adam Edelman and Frank Thorp V
Trump “knew enough to cancel” plans for a march to the Capitol — though he never did, the committee said in the executive summary of its final report. 
“By the time President Trump was preparing to give his speech, he and his advisors knew enough to cancel the rally. And he certainly knew enough to cancel any plans for a march to the Capitol,” the committee wrote.
“According to testimony obtained by the Select Committee, Trump knew that elements of the crowd were armed, and had prohibited items, and that many thousands would not pass through the magnetometers for that reason. Testimony indicates that the President had received an earlier security briefing, and testimony indicates that the Secret Service mentioned the prohibited items again as they drove President Trump to the Ellipse,” the summary stated.

In a virtual news conference late Monday afternoon, conservative attorney John Eastman pushed back against the committee's characterization of his request for a presidential pardon.
The committee wrote in its executive summary that Eastman's request to be added to the “pardon list” after Jan. 6, 2021, revealed his “clear consciousness of guilt.""
Eastman argued he'd asked to be put on the list in response to ""weeks"" of false attacks against him.
""I said, look, given that false story maybe I should be on the pardon list, just to avoid having to defend against that — what was clearly constitutionally protected speech,"" Eastman said, adding that it ""never went anywhere.""
The committee said Monday it would send a criminal referral for Eastman to the Justice Department, arguing that he was the architect of an unlawful scheme to pressure Pence to reject states’ electoral votes on Jan. 6 and have fake electors submitted to Congress instead.
Eastman also seemed to offer a preview of his defense to a potential criminal indictment, saying that whether or not he acted “corruptly” would be “front and center to the case.”
“To prove that there would have to be first evidence that there was no illegality or fraud in the election and that I knew that at the time,” Eastman said. “And neither of those things is true.""

As Rudy Giuliani pushed forward with litigation to sow doubt on the election process, Trump campaign staffers began viewing Giuliani as “unhinged,” the executive summary of the committee’s report says.
Multiple law firms that had worked for the campaign quit after having refused to participate in his legal strategy, it continues.
Campaign manager Bill Stepien, who recalled growing “wary of the new team,” told the committee he had his assistant lock his door.
“And, sure enough, Mayor Giuliani tried to get in my office and ordered her to unlock the door, and she didn’t do that,"" he said. ""She’s smart about that.”
Garrett Haake and Matt Korade
While the committee was meeting, former President Donald Trump repeated his claim in a radio interview that ahead of Jan. 6 he ordered thousands of troops to be ready to respond in case of protests — an assertion the panel had refuted in the executive summary of its report.
Asked in an interview with conservative talk radio host Dan Bongino about the committee's actions Monday, Trump called the panel ""a kangaroo court"" and said its members had failed to mention his video statement hours after the riot began urging his supporters to go home. He added that the committee also didn't mention his claim that he ordered 10,000 troops to be prepared for protests days before the riot unfolded. 
The committee, however, addressed that claim in its summary.
“Some have suggested that President Trump gave an order to have 10,000 troops ready for January 6th. The select committee found no evidence of this."" it said. ""In fact, President Trump’s acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller directly refuted this when he testified under oath.""
The summary then quoted Miller as telling committee staff members ""there was no order from the president.""
Asked for comment about the committee's criminal referrals, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung repeated a statement the campaign has used previously, calling the panel a ""Kangaroo court"" that ""held show trials by Never Trump partisans who are a stain on this country’s history.""
Kyle Stewart
Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., responded to the committee's decision to refer him and three other Republicans to the Ethics Committee for defying its subpoenas, calling the referral “their final political stunt.”
Biggs accused the committee of defaming “my name and my character.”
“They only wanted the testimony to have the ability to edit and misconstrue our statements to further their own false narratives, as they did with so many other witnesses,” Biggs said.
 
Summer Concepcion and Sarah Fitzpatrick
Trump lawyers and supporters — including Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, Phil Waldron and Michael Flynn — were asked by the committee to provide proof supporting their claims that the election was stolen. In response, they invoked their Fifth Amendment right, the summary said. Those making the claims did not provide any evidence in subpoenaed documents, either, according to the committee.
“Not a single witness — nor any combination of witnesses — provided the select committee with evidence demonstrating that fraud occurred on a scale even remotely close to changing the outcome in any state.”
“In short, it was a big scam,” a footnote read.
Liz Brown-Kaiser
Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger testified before the Senate Rules Committee on Monday about changes at the agency since Jan. 6, 2021, and a massive increase in threats against lawmakers over the last few years.
Manger revealed that Capitol Police saw over 9,000 threats against members of Congress last year, and he specifically called out the attacks on Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., and Paul Pelosi.
“I can tell you that back in 2017, we had 1,000, maybe, somewhere around 1,000, and last year 9,000, and it has gone up steadily and profoundly over the last five or six years,” he told senators.
Manger also discussed the agency's “to-do list” since Jan. 6, from managing security risks to recruitment.
“Among the most significant challenges that we’re facing is the ever-changing threat landscape,” Manger said. “Hate, intolerance and violence are part of a disturbing trend.”

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., released a brief statement about the committee's final hearing Monday evening.
“The entire nation knows who is responsible for that day. Beyond that, I don’t have any immediate observations,"" McConnell said in a statement shared by his office.
Daniel Barnes and Rebecca Shabad
Conservative attorney John Eastman said Monday that the ""American people have been ill-served by the January 6th committee and its members"" after it unveiled plans to refer him to the Justice Department.
In a statement, he said the committee's move — a nonbinding recommendation that he be investigated and prosecuted — carries no more weight than if a regular person had done it.
""In fact, a 'referral' from the January 6th committee should carry a great deal less weight due to the absurdly partisan nature of the process that produced it,"" he said. 
The committee says Eastman was the architect of an unlawful scheme to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject states’ electoral votes on Jan. 6 and have fake electors submitted to the Congress instead. 
Eastman said the committee ""had the resources and mandate to make important contributions in the area of Capitol Security, Electoral Count Act Reform and other areas of potential legislation.""
But, he said: ""Sadly, this opportunity has been squandered in favor of concocting a pretend 'criminal case' from pretend prosecutors designed to create political advantage for the Democratic Party and stigmatize disfavored political groups."" 
The House did pass an overhaul of the Electoral Count Act in September; the Senate hasn't passed it. Legislation that would reform the law is expected to be included in a coming massive government spending package Congress is expected to consider this week.
Adam Edelman and Ghael Fobes
The committee believes the Department of Justice can compel former White House counsel Pat Cipollone to testify about his conversations with Trump, the report summary says.
Cipollone spoke to the committee, and his testimony is quoted extensively in the panel's summary. But he had avoided discussing direct talks with Trump with the committee, because of executive privilege concerns.
“During the ensuing riot, the president refused to condemn the violence or encourage the crowd to disperse despite repeated pleas from his staff and family that he do so,"" the summary says. ""The committee has evidence from multiple sources establishing these facts, including testimony from former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.”
“Although Cipollone’s testimony did not disclose a number of direct communications with President Trump in light of concerns about executive privilege, the department now appears to have obtained a ruling that Cipollone can testify before a grand jury about these communications,"" the summary’s authors wrote. ""Based on the information it has obtained, the committee believes that Cipollone and others can provide direct testimony establishing that President Trump refused repeatedly, for multiple hours, to make a public statement directing his violent and lawless supporters to leave the Capitol.""
Summer Concepcion and Michael Kosnar
A White House security official who monitored Secret Service transmissions from the White House recalls members of then-Vice President Mike Pence’s detail “starting to fear for their own lives” as the Capitol attack unfolded, the report summary said.
“There was a lot of yelling, a lot of — I don’t know — a lot [of] very personal calls over the radio,” said the official, whose identity the committee said it withheld because of national security concerns and to guard against retaliation. “So it was disturbing. I don’t like talking about it, but there were calls to say goodbye to family members, so on and so forth. It was getting — for whatever the reason was on the ground — the VP detail thought that this was about to get very ugly.”
The official said members of Pence's detail thought they were “running out of options” and were “getting nervous,” and it sounded like they “came very close to either Service having to use lethal options or worse,” according to the summary.
Adam Edelman and Liz Brown-Kaiser
Members of the Jan. 6 committee, Reps. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., and Adam Schiff, D-Calif., told reporters that the criminal referrals would be sent to the Department of Justice this week but declined to elaborate on additional specifics.
“We just have a few more days in businesses so certainly it will happen this week,” Raskin said Monday in response to a question about quickly the committee would send material to DOJ.
When asked whether the committee would be “filling in the blank” of who was among the “others,” after Trump and Eastman, to be included in the referrals, Raskin said only that “the others are all contained in our report, and that’s a judgment that’s going to have to be made by the Department of Justice about whether they have sufficient evidence and probable cause in their case in order to bring charges.”
Schiff, for his part, said that Trump should be treated like “any other American” by the Justice Department as it weighs whether to charge him.
“We believe as we indicated in our criminal referral that Donald J. Trump that there was evidence that he violated multiple criminal laws,” Schiff said. “If the Justice Department concurs with that assessment and with the evidence, then he should be prosecuted like any other American.”

Two of the four members of Congress referred to the House Ethics Committee by the Jan. 6 committee slammed the panel Monday. 
In a statement to NBC News, Russell Dye, a spokesperson for Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, said, ""This is just another partisan and political stunt made by a select committee that knowingly altered evidence, blocked minority representation on a committee for the first time in the history of the U.S. House of Representatives, and failed to respond to Mr. Jordan’s numerous letters and concerns surrounding the politicization and legitimacy of the committee’s work.""
Jay Ostrich, a spokesperson for Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., said, ""More games from a petulant and soon-to-be defunct kangaroo court desperate for revenge and struggling to get out from under the weight of its own irrelevancy.""
The offices of the two other members, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., and Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., did not immediately return NBC News' request for comment.
Rebecca Shabad and Allie Raffa
In its report summary, the committee detailed what it said were efforts to obstruct its investigation.
For example, the committee said it had received testimony from a witness about her decision to terminate a lawyer who was being paid by a group allied with Trump.
The witness, whom the summary didn’t identify, expressed concern that the lawyer advised her that she could ""tell the committee that she did not recall facts when she actually did recall them,"" the summary said. 
The client was also offered ""potential employment that would make her 'financially very comfortable' as the date of her testimony approached by entities apparently linked to Donald Trump and his associates,"" the summary continued.
The witness also testified that multiple people linked to Trump contacted her in advance of her testimony. 
""What they said to me is, as long as I continue to be a team player, they know that I am on the right team. I am doing the right thing. I am protecting who I need to protect,"" the witness said. ""You know, I will continue to stay in good graces in Trump world. And they have reminded me a couple of times that Trump does read transcripts and just keep that in mind as I proceed through my interviews with the committee.""
The committee said it's also aware of multiple efforts by Trump to contact witnesses that went before the panel's investigators. ""The Department of Justice is aware of at least one of those circumstances,"" the summary said. It also said much of this evidence is already known by the Department of Justice and other prosecutorial authorities.
Vaughn Hillyard and Rebecca Shabad
Trump has done little over the course of the committee's investigation to deny or respond to the allegations and evidence the panel has presented against him. 
Scott Wong and Sarah Mimms
The committee announced during Monday's final meeting that it was referring four Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee for defying subpoenas from the committee earlier this year.
But Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., did not name those members during the meeting. Instead, those names were made public in a summary of the committee's final report.
They are: House Minority Leader and potential incoming Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif; Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who is expected to be the next chairman of the House Judiciary Committee; Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.; and Scott Perry, R-Pa.
“Despite the Select Committee’s repeated attempts to obtain information from these Members and the issuance of subpoenas, each has refused to cooperate and failed to comply with a lawfully issued subpoena,"" according to the report summary. ""Accordingly, the Select Committee is referring their failure to comply with the subpoenas issued to them to the Ethics Committee for further action. To be clear, this referral is only for failure to comply with lawfully issued subpoenas. “
Rebecca Shabad and Ghael Fobes
The Jan. 6 committee said in the summary of its report that the Department of Justice and the district attorney in Fulton County, Georgia, might be able to access information unavailable to the congressional panel. 
The DOJ and the district attorney in Georgia could ""utilize investigative tools, including search warrants and grand juries, superior to the means the committee has for obtaining relevant information and testimony,"" the summary says.
Prosecutors might now have access to testimony from Mark Meadows, Trump's former White House chief of staff, ""and others who either asserted privileges or invoked their Fifth Amendment rights.""
""The department may also be able to access, via grand jury subpoena or otherwise, the testimony of Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, Representative Scott Perry, Representative Jim Jordan and others, each of whom appears to have had materially relevant communications with Donald Trump or others in the White House but who failed to comply with the Select Committee’s subpoenas,"" the summary said. 
Adam Edelman
Outgoing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., thanked the members of the Jan. 6 committee for being “relentless” in “their pursuit of truth” and demanded that “justice must be done” following the panel’s last public meeting.
“With painstaking detail, this executive summary documents the sinister plot to subvert the Congress, shred the Constitution and halt the peaceful transfer of power,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""The committee has reached important conclusions about the evidence it has developed, and I respect those findings.” 
“Our Founders made clear that, in the United States of America, no one is above the law.  This bedrock principle remains unequivocally true, and justice must be done,” she added.
Sahil Kapur
The committee's executive summary highlights a series of revelations and accusations against key figures who have testified. 
Among them, the panel accuses Ivanka Trump of not being as ""forthcoming as Cipollone and others about President Trump’s conduct,"" saying she exhibited “a lack of full recollection of certain issues.”
She wasn’t the only White House official the panel called out. It said portions of former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany’s testimony “seemed evasive, as if she was testifying from pre-prepared talking points.” It added: “In multiple instances, McEnany’s testimony did not seem nearly as forthright as that of her press office staff, who testified about what McEnany said.”
Read more highlights from the report summary.
Rebecca Shabad and Daniel Barnes
The executive summary says the committee believes Trump wanted to go to the Capitol on Jan. 6 to personally lead the effort to overturn Joe Biden's victory.
""The committee’s principal concern was that the president actually intended to participate personally in the January 6th efforts at the Capitol, leading the attempt to overturn the election either from inside the House chamber, from a stage outside the Capitol, or otherwise,"" the summary said. 
""The committee regarded those facts as important because they are relevant to President Trump’s intent on January 6th,"" the summary continued. ""There is no question from all the evidence assembled that President Trump did have that intent.""
The summary then said a White House security official who was in the White House complex on Jan. 6 became ""very concerned about his intentions,"" referring to Trump. The committee interviewed the official on July 11, 2022, and kept his identity confidential ""due to their sensitive national security responsibilities.""
""[W]e all knew what that implicated and what that meant, that this was no longer a rally, that this was going to move to something else if he physically walked to the Capitol,"" the official said. ""I don’t know if you want to use the word 'insurrection,' 'coup,' whatever. We all knew that this would move from a normal, democratic, you know, public event into something else.""
Adam Edelman and Daniel Barnes
The committee's executive summary also provides more detail on the bombshell testimony this summer from Cassidy Hutchinson, a former top aide to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.
Hutchinson had testified that Trump tried to grab the steering wheel of his presidential vehicle and lunged toward his security detail when he was informed he would not be taken to the Capitol after his Jan. 6 rally.
“After he exited the stage, President Trump entered the presidential SUV and forcefully expressed his intention that Bobby Engel, the head of his Secret Service detail, direct the motorcade to the Capitol,"" the summary says. ""The committee has now obtained evidence from several sources about a ‘furious interaction’ in the SUV.""
""The vast majority of witnesses who have testified before the select committee about this topic, including multiple members of the Secret Service, a member of the Metropolitan Police, and national security officials in the White House, described President Trump’s behavior as 'irate,' 'furious,' 'insistent,' 'profane' and 'heated,'"" the summary stated.
Rebecca Shabad and Sarah Fitzpatrick
Former Trump lawyer and longtime ally Rudy Giuliani, who helped fuel Trump's lies about the 2020 election, said he did not believe the outlandish claims he pushed about voting machines fixing the election, according to the committee's summary of its report.
""Giuliani repeatedly had claimed in public that Dominion voting machines stole the election,"" the summary said, but added, ""He admitted during his Select Committee deposition that, 'I do not think the machines stole the election.'"" 
Soon after Jan. 6, Dominion Voting Systems, the election equipment manufacturer that became the target of wild conspiracy theories pushed by  Trump and his allies, sued Giuliani for defamation.
NBC News
The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol released a 154-page summary of its findings Monday, the culmination of nearly 18 months of work.
The committee says it expects to release the full report later this week, as well as a number of transcripts from witness depositions.
Read what the committee is calling its introductory material here.
Vaughn Hillyard and Rebecca Shabad
During the Jan. 6 committee's final meeting, Trump made one post to his Truth Social account, saying he would have won the 2020 election if Twitter had not blocked a New York Post story about Hunter Biden.
""This would have easily changed the Presidential Election outcome without even discussing all of the other illegal things they did,"" Trump wrote on his account. 
Trump linked to a Fox News article related to Twitter’s decision to block the New York Post story on Hunter Biden ahead of the 2020 election. Trump was suggesting that Twitter’s suppression of the story would have given him a second term in the White House.  
Ali Vitali and Scott Wong
The Jan. 6 committee met for what’s likely its final public meeting, with many of the usual faces present. As ever, officers who defended the Capitol were front row — including U.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, Washington, D.C., Police Officer Daniel Hodges and former Washington Police Officer Michael Fanone.
Reps. Madeline Dean and Mary Gay Scanlon, both Pennsylvania Democrats, former Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-Va., and some members of Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s staff were also present in the room.
The hearing room had a quiet energy as the lawmakers began, which endured for the entirety of the meeting. 
During a lengthy Jan. 6 highlight reel, members looked very serious and solemn. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., sitting next to Cheney, had his hands clasped in front of his face for a full minute.
When Raskin began reading out the referral recommendations, the mood in the room became more tense and alert. Some people took pictures of the screen that laid out specific statutes against Trump, Eastman “and others,” aware that his information was new and what many were waiting on.
As they took the recorded vote of each member saying “aye” to adopt the panel's final report, the room shifted and some attendees took pictures or video on their phones.
Some applause broke out right after the hearing wrapped and as members exited. Reps. Stephanie Murphy and Pete Aguilar went to shake hands with the officers in the front row. 
Matt Korade
The House Jan. 6 committee concluded its meeting, marking an end to nearly a year and a half of work investigating the events surrounding the riot at the Capitol.
Rebecca Shabad
The committee has voted unanimously to adopt its final report, which Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., said includes the panel's legislative recommendations and criminal referrals of Trump and others.
Adam Edelman
Raskin also announced that his committee would refer four members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee for having refused to comply with subpoenas issued by the Jan. 6 panel.
“None of the subpoenaed members complied, and we are now referring four members of Congress for appropriate sanction by the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with lawful subpoenas,” Raskin said.
Raskin did not immediately say which four members of Congress the panel would refer to the Ethics Committee.
There were five members who did not comply with their subpoena requests from the committee: House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.; Rep. Scott Perry, R-Pa.; Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio; Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz.; and Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala.
Summer Concepcion
Raskin said the committee will also refer Trump under a U.S. criminal code for inciting, assisting, or engaging in insurrection against the United States and giving ""aid or comfort"" to an insurrection.
""An insurrection is a rebellion against the authority of the United States. It is a grave federal offense anchored in the Constitution. ... Anyone who incites others to engage in rebelling, assists them in doing so or gives aid and comfort to those engaged in insurrection is guilty of a federal crime,"" Raskin said.
“The Committee believes that more than sufficient evidence exists for a criminal referral of former President Trump for assisting or aiding and comforting those at the Capitol who engaged in a violent attack on the United States,” Raskin continued. “The Committee has developed significant evidence that President Trump intended to disrupt the peaceful transition of power.”
Summer Concepcion
Raskin said the committee is making a referral for Trump and others who made “materially false statements” to the federal government “knowingly and willfully.”
“The evidence clearly suggests that President Trump conspired with others to submit slates of fake electors to Congress and the National Archives,” Raskin said. “We believe that this evidence we set forth in our report is more than sufficient for a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump and others in connection with this offense.”
Adam Edelman
Raskin has announced that “there is more than sufficient evidence” to issue criminal referrals asking the Justice Department to pursue criminal charges against Trump, Eastman “and others” for conspiring to defraud the U.S.
“In other words, to make an agreement to impair, obstruct, or defeat the lawful functions of the United States government by deceitful or dishonest means,” Raskin said.
Rebecca Shabad and Adam Edelman
Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said the committee will refer Trump, lawyer John Eastman and others for obstructing an official proceeding. 
Raskin said the first criminal statute the panel will invoke for referral ""makes it unlawful for anyone to corruptly 'obstruct, influence, or impede any official proceeding' of the United States government.""
""We believe that the evidence described by my colleagues today and assembled throughout our hearings warrants a criminal referral of former President Donald J. Trump, John Eastman, and others for violations of this statute,"" Raskin said. ""The whole purpose and obvious effect of Trump’s scheme were to 'obstruct, influence, and impede' this official proceeding, the central moment for the lawful transfer of power in the United States.""
As is the case with all of the criminal referrals being issued by the committee, these carry no official legal weight, and it remains up to the Department of Justice to decide whether or not to charge the former president and anyone else who might be referred by the committee.
Adam Edelman
Committee members played new testimony from former Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, in which she described Trump defending the rioters in a private conversation on Jan. 7.
Conway told interviewers that during that short conversation with Trump, she'd called Jan. 6 a ""terrible day"" and called it ""crazy.""
Asked by interviewers about what Trump said during the conversation, Conway said that Trump defended the rioters saying, “No, these people are upset. They’re very upset.""
Rebecca Shabad and Frank Thorp V
The committee recounted text messages it received from Hope Hicks, who was serving as a senior White House adviser on the day of the riot.
Hicks was texting with another staffer during the violence to say she had “suggested ... several times” on Jan. 4 and Jan. 5, 2021, that Trump state publicly that Jan. 6 should remain peaceful, and that ""he"" refused her advice, Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., said.
""Hey. I know you’re seeing this. But he ... really should tweet something about Being NON-violent,"" campaign spokesman Hogan Gidley texted Hicks, according to the panel.
Hicks responded: ""I’m not there. I suggested it several times Monday and Tuesday and he refused.""
The committee asked Hicks whether ""he"" referred to Trump, but Hicks said she was talking about White House attorney Eric Herschmann. Murphy suggested the public review the transcript of the panel's interview with Herschmann when it is released.
Hicks recalled in testimony before the committee that Herschmann had earlier advised Trump to make a pre-emptive public statement in advance of Jan. 6 urging no violence that day.
Trump never made any such statement. 
Rebecca Shabad
Rep. Stephanie Murphy, D-Fla., said Trump summoned a mob to Washington on Jan. 6, hoping that they would pressure Congress ""to do what he could not do on his own.""
On Dec. 19, 2020, Trump posted a tweet urging his supporters to travel to Washington for a protest on Jan. 6, Murphy said. ""Be there, will be wild!"" he tweeted.
""Between December 19th and January 6th, the president repeatedly encouraged his supporters to come to Washington,"" she said. 
Trump's tweet on Dec. 19 ""galvanized domestic violent extremists, including members of the Oath Keepers, the Proud Boys, and organized militia groups,"" Murphy said. 
The committee found that these people planned to come to D.C. in large numbers ""with the specific intent to use violence to disrupt the certification of the election during the joint session,"" she said. 
Summer Concepcion
Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., stressed that Trump still attempted to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to go along with lawyer John Eastman’s theory on overturning the election results, despite Pence and Eastman himself warning that it would be unlawful to do so.
“John Eastman admitted in advance of the 2020 election that Mike Pence could not lawfully refuse to count official electoral votes,” Aguilar said. 
“But he nevertheless devised a meritless proposal that deployed a combination of bogus election fraud claims and the fake electoral ballots to say that Mike Pence, presiding over the joint session, could reject legitimate electoral votes for President-elect Biden,” he continued.
Adam Edelman
Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., summarized how Trump had sought to use the Department of Justice to invalidate the 2020 election — but that none of Trump’s attorneys general would go along with it.
Kinzinger said that when Bill Barr resigned as attorney general, after having investigated and disproven many of Trump’s false claims of voter fraud, Trump then requested that the acting leaders of the department, Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, “just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen.” 
“Between Dec. 23rd and Jan. 3rd, President Trump called or met with them nearly every day, and was told repeatedly that department investigations showed no factual support for Trump’s fraud allegations. Mr. Rosen and Mr. Donoghue told him that his fraud claims were simply untrue,” Kinzinger said. 
Trump then attempted to install Jeffrey Clark to lead the agency. But a wave of officials threatened to resign if Trump did so, and Trump did not move forward with installing Clark, Kinzinger said.
Rebecca Shabad
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Trump oversaw an effort to obtain and transmit false Electoral College ballots to Congress and the National Archives. 
The false ballots were created by fake GOP electors on Dec. 14, Schiff said, at the same time that the actual, certified electors were meeting in those particular states to cast their votes for Biden. 
At that point, election-related litigation was over or nearly complete in these states, and Trump campaign lawyers realized fake electors were ""unjustifiable on any grounds, and may be unlawful,"" Schiff said. 
""In spite of these concerns, and the concerns of individuals in the White House Counsel’s Office, President Trump and others proceeded with this plan,"" Schiff said. 
Schiff said the committee has developed evidence that shows ""these intentionally false documents were transmitted to multiple officers of the federal government, and were intended to interfere with the proper conduct of the joint session"" on Jan. 6.
Adam Edelman
Committee members are drawing attention to how even many of Trump’s closest confidantes had told the former president they felt there had been no evidence of widespread voter fraud that would have had the potential to affect the outcome of the 2020 election — but that he remained unswayed.
One such person was Hope Hicks, who served as a top adviser to Trump for years.
“I wasn’t seeing evidence of fraud on a scale that would have impacted the outcome of the election. And I was becoming increasingly concerned that we were damaging his legacy,” Hicks said, according to a recording of her testimony that was played Monday.
When asked by interviewers in the recording how Trump responded, Hicks replied, ""He said something along the lines of, you know, ‘Nobody will care about my legacy if I lose, so that won’t matter. The only thing that matters is winning.’”
Rebecca Shabad
Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., said then- President Donald Trump ""unlawfully"" tried to overturn the 2020 election results, saying it was a ""premeditated"" effort.
""The committee has evidence that ex-President Trump planned to declare victory and, unlawfully, to call for the vote counting to stop, and that he told numerous allies about his intent in the weeks before the election,"" she said. 
Lofgren said the committee found that Trump ""raised hundreds of millions of dollars with false representations made to his online donors. The proceeds from this fundraising, we have learned, have been used in ways that we believe are concerning.""
The committee, for example, learned that some of the funds were used to hire lawyers, Lofgren said, adding the panel has evidence of efforts to provide or offer employment to witnesses. 
One witness's lawyer told the witness that she could ""tell the committee that she didn’t recall facts when she actually did recall them,"" Lofgren said.
""That lawyer also did not disclose who was paying for the lawyer’s representation, despite questions from the client seeking that information,"" Lofgren said. 
The lawyer told his client, ""'We’re not telling people where funding is coming from right now,'"" Lofgren added.
The committee learned that a client was offered potential employment ""that would make her 'financially very comfortable' as the date of her testimony approached by entities that were apparently linked to Donald Trump and his associates,"" Lofgren said. ""These offers were withdrawn or didn’t materialize as reports of the content of her testimony circulated.""
Liz Brown-Kaiser
Jan. 6 committee Chair Rep. Bennie Thompson told reporters shortly before beginning the meeting Monday that he had ""no plans"" to speak with special counsel Jack Smith regarding the information that the panel has collected.
In November, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Smith, who most recently served as chief prosecutor for the special court in The Hague, as special counsel overseeing the Justice Department's investigations into former President Donald Trump, citing in part Trump's announcement that he is running for president.
Smith is investigating Trump's handling of classified documents found at Mar-a-Lago, as well as “key aspects” of the investigation into Trump's role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.
Thompson said the committee will send its referrals to the Justice Department “shortly after we take care of business today.”
Summer Concepcion
Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the vice chair of the committee, excoriated former President Donald Trump for refusing to do his duty in ensuring a peaceful transfer of power and for failing to issue a condemnation as the Capitol attack unfolded.
“Among the most shameful of this committee’s findings was that President Trump sat in the dining room off the Oval Office watching the violent riot at the Capitol on television,” Cheney said.
Cheney noted that law enforcement agents were under attack and the electoral count was halted as a mob of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6.
“It was an utter moral failure and a clear dereliction of duty,” Cheney said.
Rebecca Shabad
Four police officers who defended the Capitol and lawmakers during the riot, and who were critical witnesses to the events of Jan. 6, are in the committee's meeting room watching the final event in person. 
The four officers are D.C. Officer Daniel Hodges, who was crushed by the mob at the Capitol on Jan. 6; former U.S. Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, who recently resigned from the force; D.C. Police Officer Michael Fanone; and U.S. Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn. 
Summer Concepcion
In opening remarks, committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., previewed the timeline for the public release of transcripts of the panel’s hearings as well as its final report.
Thompson said he expects the committee’s final report to be filed with the clerk of the House and made public later this week. The committee is set to outline a number of recommendations in its final report, he said.
The committee also intends to release the bulk of its nonsensitive records to the public before the end of the year.
“These transcripts and documents will allow the American people to see for themselves the body of evidence we’ve gathered and continue to explore the information that has led us to our conclusions,” Thompson said.
He expressed confidence that the work of the committee will ""help provide a roadmap to justice, and that the agencies and institutions responsible for ensuring justice under the law will use the information we’ve provided to aid their work.""

The Jan. 6 committee has gaveled in for its final public meeting.
Jonathan Allen
The Jan. 6 committee really had no other option than to issue criminal referrals for former President Donald Trump to the Justice Department, as it plans to do when members meet Monday afternoon.
Otherwise, lawmakers would have undercut their own votes to impeach Trump for incitement of insurrection in January 2021, one week before he left office. 
In the article adopted then on a 232-197 vote, the House found that ""Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States."" Additionally, the article made the specific allegation that Trump obstructed government proceedings, namely the certification of President Joe Biden's victory. 
The implicit mission of the Jan. 6 committee was to find and publicize evidence that supported claims that Trump acted illegally in his effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election and remain in power.
The lawmakers will argue this week that they found that evidence and it requires the Justice Department to act.

The White House will be carefully and quietly watching the Jan. 6 Committee’s final public meeting today, multiple officials told NBC News.
Key aides, however, aren’t expected to provide any formal reaction or weigh in on any of the possible criminal referrals and will likely defer to the Justice Department, these sources say.
Although President Joe Biden has publicly condemned the Capitol attack as a threat to democracy, the administration has intentionally made efforts to avoid any risk of appearing to interfere with any criminal investigation, especially probes in connection to former President Donald Trump. The same case applies this week as the congressional panel wraps up its work, officials said.
Biden is scheduled to meet with the president of Ecuador this afternoon while the committee’s public hearing gets underway.

Republicans plan to release a counter report designed to serve as a rebuttal to the Jan 6 committee’s final report.
The group of Republicans who were denied access to the Jan. 6th Select Committee after a squabble between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, are writing their own report that is expected to be more than 100 pages.
A spokesperson for Rep. Jim Banks, one of the five GOP members who were picked by McCarthy to serve on the committee, told NBC News their report is expected later this week, around the same time the committee’s full report drops.
Republicans have been critical of the committee for not focusing enough on the security and intelligence failures around the Capitol leading up to and on Jan. 6. They’ve also suggested the committee lacks a clear legislative purpose.
“That just shows me ... that the select committee was less about achieving the goals of the bipartisan commission that I wrote and supported than they were about just getting scoring political points,” said Rep. Rodney Davis, another of the GOP members tapped to serve on the Jan. 6th committee. 
Axios was first to report of the GOP plans to counter the Select Committee’s report. 
Ryan J. Reilly
The Justice Department's inspector general said ahead of the Jan. 6 committee's meeting that the office is examining potential ""weaknesses in DOJ protocols, policies, or procedures that adversely affected DOJ’s ability to effectively prepare for and respond to the events at the U.S. Capitol.""
In an annual report on the Justice Department's top management challenges, the inspector general said that its ongoing review of DOJ's preparations for Jan. 6 would also ""address important issues"" emphasized in the Biden administration's National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.
“As has long been the case in this arena, the significant hurdle to this strategy is preserving individuals’ First Amendment right to free speech or activity while protecting against the threat to national security,” the report states.
The inspector general said domestic terrorism is one of the biggest issues facing the Justice Department, as is strengthening public trust in DOJ. The inspector general said the department faces a ""significant challenge"" in making sure enforcement of the law is even-handed.
""Objectivity is equally important in the Department’s exercise of its law enforcement authorities. The law enforcement responses to protests in the spring and summer of 2020 at Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C.; Portland, Oregon; and elsewhere, following the deaths of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and others, have been contrasted with the treatment of rioters at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021,"" the report says. 
""The Department faces a significant challenge in ensuring that its law enforcement authority is wielded responsibly and without improper consideration or bias,"" the inspector general said. ""Public accountability and transparency about its actions is necessary to address perceived disparities in law enforcement responses to these events.""

The Jan. 6 committee intends to send criminal referrals to the Justice Department against Trump lawyer John Eastman, a key figure in former President Donald Trump’s challenges to the 2020 election results, two sources familiar with the panel’s deliberations tell NBC News.
Members of the committee said during a dress rehearsal overheard by NBC News on Sunday that the panel believed it had sufficient evidence to refer Eastman.
“Of course, President Trump did not act alone,” Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., was overheard telling his colleagues Sunday. “There is significant evidence to the fact that Eastman was part of this conspiracy” and, additionally, “it is now clear that this conspiracy involved many more people other than Dr. Eastman.”
Raskin also said Eastman was “centrally involved” in a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election results.
The committee will likely reveal Eastman’s referrals during Monday’s meeting, in addition to expected criminal referrals for Trump.
A source familiar with the committee’s plans told NBC News about the committee’s Sunday meeting and its location on the Capitol complex.
Allie Raffa and Haley Talbot
The Jan. 6th committee spent nearly 18 months investigating the attack on the U.S. Capitol and the events surrounding it. During that time, the panel:
Daniel Barnes and Summer Concepcion
Jury selection begins Monday in the trial of Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the Proud Boys, and four other members of the group. Each of them are charged with seditious conspiracy and other felonies for their actions leading up to and on Jan. 6, 2021.
Tarrio is charged along with three other defendants, who are accused of being leaders of their local Proud Boy chapters: Ethan Nordean of Washington, Joseph Biggs of Florida and Zachary Rehl of Pennsylvania. The fifth defendant, Dominic Pezzola, is accused of using a stolen police shield to break a window in the Capitol that allowed rioters to climb inside the building.
Although Tarrio was not physically in D.C. on Jan. 6, prosecutors allege he helped plan the group’s strategy and actions during the Capitol attack.
Jury selection is expected to take place throughout this week before opening statements on Jan. 3.
Summer Concepcion
Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said Sunday that the House Jan. 6 committee has evidence that former President Donald Trump broke the law, but he declined to get specific about the criminal referrals it will make.
In an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union,” Schiff, a member of the committee, cited multiple efforts by Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election, including pressuring state officials to go along with his false claims of widespread election fraud. “If that’s not criminal, then I don’t know what it is,” he said.
Schiff, however, declined to comment on specific referrals, saying the panel is set to vote on them and will reveal its decision Monday, as well as release its final report later this month.
“But I can tell you that our process has been to look meticulously at the evidence and compare it to various statutes. Is there sufficient evidence as to each element of a particular crime?” he said. “We are not referring, or at least won’t be voting to refer, everyone we think there may be evidence, because we want to focus on those for which we believe there’s the strongest evidence.”

The House Jan. 6 committee met Sunday to finalize its plans to issue at least three criminal referrals for former President Donald Trump, NBC News learned exclusively.
The committee is expected to vote on referrals asking the Justice Department to pursue at least three criminal charges against Trump related to the Capitol riot: obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the government and inciting or assisting an insurrection.
Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said in part during the meeting overheard by NBC News that he believed referrals were “warranted.” A source familiar with the committee’s plans told NBC News about the meeting and its location on the Capitol complex.
The criminal referrals carry no official legal weight, and it remains up to the Justice Department to decide whether or not to charge Trump and anyone else the committee might refer.
The committee also plans to refer several Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee for their defiance of congressional subpoenas, NBC News has learned.

A selection of the 1000 people who have been charged for the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol in 2021.
More than two years after rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol, prosecutors have now charged more than 1,000 people in relation to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack.
These hundreds of people encompass ""the most wide-ranging investigation"" in the history of the Justice Department. NPR has been tracking every case related to the attack as they move through the court system, from the initial arrest to sentencing.
The investigation has been a massive undertaking, both in its scope and cost. Every U.S. Attorney's office has been involved, as well as every FBI field office. As part of the $1.7 trillion government spending package passed in December, $2.6 billion was allocated to the U.S. Attorneys, in part to support the Jan. 6 prosecutions.
In order to bring charges, the Justice Department is sifting through mountains of evidence and chasing down tips. The FBI says it has been reviewing almost four million files, including 30,000 video files. Those include police body-worn camera footage from five different law enforcement agencies, surveillance footage from the building, as well as the many videos on seized cell phones and posted online.
""For context, these files amount to over nine terabytes of information and would take at least 361 days to view continuously,"" the FBI reported when it marked the attack's second anniversary.
The sprawling investigation has already doubled the FBI's domestic terrorism caseload, yet the Justice Department has indicated that it believes around 2,000 people were involved in the attack. In other words, the department may not even be halfway through its investigation.
The defendants – who came from nearly all 50 states – are a tough group to generalize. Most of them appear to be white men, though not entirely.
About 15% of the defendants have a background in the military or law enforcement. For context, about 7% of the U.S. population are military veterans. Police and sheriff patrol officers make up less than 1% of the population.
The difficulty in categorizing this group has caused some experts concern. One in four defendants are facing assault or some other violent charge, yet the vast majority of people facing charges – nearly 85% – do not have any known connection to extremist groups.
""It's not like they all had previous convictions for violence or this kind of long running history of violent assault against political individuals or law enforcement. They were just willing to commit violence on that day,"" says Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism. ""They truly thought the election was stolen. They truly thought that was their day in the sun, that they were the patriots. They were the heroes of that story.""
""It's not just the scary Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. Communities are learning that one does not have to be so far gone, and such a follower of extremist movements, to still be animated to some pretty dangerous efforts to undermine our democracy,"" adds Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. ""Does that mean extremism is becoming mainstream, which sounds a little bit like an oxymoron? Does it mean that the in-roads, the agendas, of those who are the farthest, most extreme, are now becoming normalized? I think the answer is yes.""
Nearly all of these cases are being heard by 21 judges in the federal district court in Washington, D.C. They were appointed by presidents from both parties from President Reagan to President Biden.
It's difficult to compare the rulings of judges because every case is different, but there are common themes in what the judges have been saying to the defendants before them. For one, the judges aren't looking at these crimes in isolation. The significance of Jan. 6, as an attempt to undermine democracy, is playing a part.
""The defendant was an active participant in a mob assault on our core democratic values and our cherished institution,"" Judge John Bates, appointed by President George W. Bush, told Thomas Fee. ""I cannot ignore that, cannot pull this misdemeanor out of that context.""
""What happened that day was, in some ways, as serious... an offense as there can be, given that it threatened the peaceful transfer of power from one president to another. The damage that was done on that day was both tangible and intangible,"" Judge Timothy Kelly, appointed by President Trump, said while sentencing Tam Dinh Pham. ""Without people like you, the collective force of the mob that day would not have been the same.""
The judges have also emphasized that being ""sucked into a vortex of misinformation"" does not absolve someone of their actions.
""No one was swept away to the Capitol. No one was carried. The rioters were adults,"" Judge Amy Berman Jackson, appointed by President Obama, told Russell James Peterson. ""This defendant, like hundreds of others, walked there on his own two feet and he bears responsibility for his own actions. There may be others who bear greater responsibility and who also must be held accountable, but this is not their day in court, it is yours.""
Judges are also interested in accountability — and whether or not a defendant has made an authentic expression of remorse. That seems to be in part because some of the judges do worry this could happen again.
""Every day we're hearing about reports of anti-democratic factions of people plotting violence, the potential threat of violence, in 2024,"" Judge Tanya Chutkan, appointed by Obama, said while sentencing Robert Palmer. ""It has to be made clear that trying to violently overthrow the government, trying to stop the peaceful transition of power and assaulting law enforcement officers in that effort is going to be met with absolutely certain punishment. Not staying at home. Not watching Netflix. Not doing what you were doing before you got arrested.""
""If people start to get the impression that you can do what happened on Jan. 6, you can associate yourself with that behavior and that there's no real consequence, then people will say why not do it again,"" Judge Reggie Walton, appointed by President George W. Bush, told Mariposa Castro.
Despite the harsh words delivered at sentencing, the judges collectively have actually given less prison time than what prosecutors have sought in around two thirds of the cases. For sentences through February of this year, there have only been six cases in which judges sentenced defendants to prison time even if prosecutors had not sought it. Chutkan, who has given time behind bars in every Jan. 6 case she's heard, was the judge in four of those cases.
More than half of the people sentenced to longer prison terms, such as two or more years, have been convicted of assault or injuring others.
The defendants who haven't received any prison time are often fined, and sentenced to a combination of probation, community service and home confinement, depending on the nature of the case. The vast majority of these defendants are charged only with ""parading or demonstrating in a Capitol building,"" which is a misdemeanor.
There are still major efforts to rewrite history, including from members of Congress who have repeatedly claimed Jan. 6 was not as violent as it clearly was. Just this month, House Republicans announced plans to ""reinvestigate"" Jan. 6.
Mary McCord, executive director of the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown Law, says she doesn't worry about another attack on the Capitol itself, but says we're perhaps in a worse position now than we were before the insurrection.
""That's because it didn't end after Jan. 6,"" she says. ""Those people are still out there eating this up and consuming this. And not all of them saw Jan. 6 as, 'Oh my gosh. Wow. Okay, boy, now I realize democracy is at stake here. I'm going to shake this off and I'm going to quit ingesting this kind of disinformation.' That's not what we saw at all. We saw a doubling down. And it's made worse because elected officials, elected officials at high levels in Congress and in the states, have doubled down.""
There have been federal efforts to combat anti-democratic sentiment. Late last year, the bipartisan House Select Committee issued its final report on Jan. 6, ultimately concluding that Trump was at least in part responsible for the riot and recommending him and others for prosecution. That report is now in the hands of U.S. special counsel Jack Smith at the Justice Department, who is tasked with investigating the former president.
Lewis, of George Washington University, says holding the rioters on Jan. 6 accountable for their actions that day is necessary, but he says we also need to hold responsible the leaders who got all those people to the Capitol that day in the first place.
""A lot of it now does come down to the special counsel and to the DOJ more broadly to recognize that if you're just going to keep arresting, you know, the 925th guy who just walked into the Capitol, took some photos and walked out, it risks missing the forest for the trees,"" he says. ""It's just becoming whack a mole at a certain point.""

Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he has been told he is a target in the Jan. 6 criminal investigation by special counsel Jack Smith.
Trump is the leading contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Smith already has criminally charged Trump with about three dozen counts related to retaining classified documents when he left the White House.
Trump also suggested he may soon face indictment for the Jan. 6 probe, which is focused on Trump's efforts to overturn his loss in the 2020 election to President Joe Biden. Trump posted his statement on his Truth Social account.
Two sources with direct knowledge of the probe confirmed to NBC News that Smith sent Trump a target letter in the case.
Such letters are sent by the Department of Justice to give people the chance to testify before a grand jury after the DOJ determines there is substantial evidence linking them to a crime.
""Deranged Jack Smith, the prosecutor with Joe Biden's DOJ, sent a letter (again, it was Sunday night!) stating that I am a TARGET of the January 6th Grand Jury investigation, and giving me a very short 4 days to report to the Grand Jury, which almost always means an Arrest and Indictment,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social site.
Trump wrote that he was given what he called the ""horrifying news"" on Sunday evening by his lawyers.
A spokesman for Smith declined to comment.
A hearing in the classified documents criminal case is set for Tuesday in Florida federal court.
Trump's lawyers have asked that any trial in that case take place after the 2024 election. Smith's prosecutors oppose that bid.
Trump is separately under criminal investigation by a Georgia state prosecutor for his attempt to get election officials there to reverse his loss to Biden in Georgia.
A spokesman for Rudy Giuliani, the lawyer who led Trump's efforts to undo his 2020 election loss, said he has not received a target letter from Smith. Lin Wood, a lawyer and Trump ally, also said he has no received such a letter.
Timothy Parlatore, a lawyer for Bernard Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner who worked with Giuliani in the election reversal effort, told NBC that Kerik has not been given a target letter.

Special counsel Jack Smith speaks about an indictment of former President Donald Trump on Tuesday at a Department of Justice office in Washington.
The criminal charges against former President Donald Trump related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election are some of the most serious allegations facing him, one law professor told NPR. 
The indictment is ""damning"" and represents real ""legal jeopardy"" for him, said University of Richmond Law Professor Carl Tobias.
The allegations that Trump interfered in the 2020 election ""cut to the heart of democracy,"" Tobias said. 
He added, ""This indictment shows how broad and deep the conspiracy was.""
Trump is currently facing dozens of criminal charges in two other cases. One in Florida is based on his alleged withholding of classified documents, and a second in New York is over the accounting of hush money payments made in 2016.
Here's a summary of the charges Trump is facing in Washington, D.C., for attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election:
Read the full indictment below.
The charge of ""conspiracy against rights"" goes back to the Civil War era.
It was passed after the Civil War as a way to stop members of the Ku Klux Klan and other similar organizations from intimidating, harassing and outright terrorizing Black voters especially in the South. 
This law was part of the Enforcement Act, passed between 1868 and 1870, and ""served as the basis for federal activism in prosecuting corruption of the franchise until most of them were repealed in the 1890s,"" according to the Justice Department.
""Conspiracy against rights"" is one surviving piece of the Enforcement Act. 
Tobias noted that prosecutors used this charge especially during the Civil Rights era to prosecute those who intimidated and terrorized Black voters at that time as well. 
In this case, prosecutors claim Trump and his allies conspired to stop people from exercising ""the right to vote, and to have one's vote counted.""
This case involves more people — at least six unnamed co-conspirators are listed by prosecutors as part of the alleged conspiracy — and is widespread geographically compared to the case brought so far in New York and Florida, Tobias noted. 
""This classified documents case is more contained and it doesn't actually impact the entire country,"" he said.
Prosecutors list alleged efforts by Trump and his allies to interfere with election proceedings in the U.S. and by pressuring officials in several states to overturn the results. 
In this case, Trump is also facing a serious Washington, D.C., federal judge with years of experience, Tobias said. The case has been assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan.
According to The Associated Press, Chutkan stood out for her tough punishment for Jan. 6 rioters. In at least seven cases examined by the AP, Chutkan imposed harsher penalties than what federal prosecutors sought for those rioters.
The AP wrote, ""Chutkan, a former assistant public defender who was nominated to the bench by President Barack Obama, has consistently taken the hardest line against Jan. 6 defendants of any judge serving on Washington's federal trial court, which is handling the more than 800 cases brought so far in the largest prosecution in Justice Department history.""

Trump 14th Amendment case
By Aditi Sangal, Meg Wagner, Adrienne Vogt, Melissa Macaya, Rob Picheta, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Ed Upright, Maureen Chowdhury and Fernando Alfonso III, CNN

Our live coverage has moved. Head here for the latest updates on Russia's invasion of Ukraine. 

From CNN's Ellie Kaufman
US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley spoke with allies in Europe by phone on Thursday, after Russia began an invasion of Ukraine.
Milley spoke with officials from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Canada. He also had a ""combined meeting with the Bucharest 9 allies,"" — Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia — according to a readout of the calls. 
Earlier Thursday, US President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced the deployment of an additional 7,000 troops to Germany from the US to support NATO allies amid the crisis. 
Milley will ""continue to conduct outreach"" to partners and allies in the coming days, the readout said. 
From CNN's Tim Lister in Kyiv
At least three more explosions reverberated across the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, at dawn on Friday. They appeared to be coming from the southwest of the city. 
It's now just past 6:30 a.m. in Kyiv. Earlier this morning, CNN teams on the ground reported hearing large blasts in the city.
In a tweet early Friday morning, Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba decried the ""horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv.""


CNN teams in Kyiv reported hearing blasts early Friday morning. 
Ukraine's Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Yenin attributed an explosion Friday to a Ukrainian ""anti-missile system shooting a (Russian) missile out of the sky."" CNN has not been able to independently verify this. 
From CNN's Tim Lister in Kyiv
The Ukrainian Defense Ministry says its armed forces have inflicted some 800 casualties on Russian forces since the invasion began in the early hours of Thursday.
It was not immediately clear whether the ministry was referring solely to the number killed.
The ministry said more than 30 Russian tanks had been destroyed, as well as seven Russian aircraft and six helicopters.
CNN is not able to independently verify Ukraine's figures.
From CNN’s Hira Humayun
The European Union announced new sanctions on Russia early Friday that would target the country's financial, energy and transport sectors, visa policy, and include export controls and export financing bans.
The sanctions will have ""maximum impact on the Russian economy and political elite,"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. “We will hold the Kremlin accountable,” she said.
She said the financial sanctions cut Russia’s most important capital markets, and that they are now targeting 70% of the Russian banking market and key state-owned companies. The sanctions will increase Russia’s borrowing costs, raise inflation and “gradually erode Russia’s industrial base,"" she said. 
An export ban will also hit Russia's oil sector, and ban the sale of all aircraft spare parts and equipment to Russian airlines, which Von der Leyen said would hit a key sector of Russia’s economy and the country’s connectivity. The sanctions also limit Russia’s access to ""crucial technology,"" she said.
Diplomats, related groups and businesspeople will no longer have privileged access to the EU, she added.
From CNN's Matthew Chance in Kyiv
Ukraine's Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Yenin has attributed an explosion early Friday over the capital, Kyiv, to a Ukrainian ""anti-missile system shooting a (Russian) missile out of the sky.""
CNN has not been able to independently verify this. Earlier Friday morning, CNN reporters on the ground in Kyiv reported hearing several loud blasts. 
Separately, Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, said Friday that Kyiv had been hit by ""cruise or ballistic missiles.""
Photos shared by Gerashchenko on Friday show a Kyiv residential building on fire, and firefighters responding on the scene as clouds of black smoke rise in the distance.
From CNN’s Xiaofei Xu in Paris


French President Emmanuel Macron is positioning himself as the mediator between Russia and Ukraine for a potential ceasefire agreement.
Macron was the first major Western leader to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin after Russian military actions began. They spoke before the summit — but Macron admitted the phone call didn’t achieve much, ""since the Russian President has chosen war.”
Macron also accused Putin of duplicity, saying he and other European leaders had been discussing ""the details of the implementation of the Minsk agreements"" with Putin just hours before the Russian President launched the operation, referring to the 2015 pact that established a shaky ceasefire in the region.
At the summit on Thursday, EU leaders signed off on a new round of sanctions, described by European Council President Charles Michel as “massive” and “painful” against Russia and Belarus.

US President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday the United States was “in consultation with India” on the issue of Ukraine and Russia. 
The comments came in response to a question on whether India, a major US defense partner, was “fully in sync” with the United States, with Biden adding, “We haven’t resolved that completely.”
India has a historic friendship with Russia. At the same time, its strategic partnership with the US has grown at an unprecedented pace over the past two decades. 
Also on Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken held a phone conversation with India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, stressing the importance of a “strong collective response” toward Russia's invasion of Ukraine, an official spokesperson said.
Following the call, Blinken tweeted a similar statement, highlighting the “importance of a strong collective response to Russian aggression,” adding “Russia’s attack on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is a clear violation of the rules-based international order.”
In response, Jaishanker tweeted: “Appreciate the call from @SecBlinken. Discussed the ongoing developments in Ukraine and its implications.""

88669,54672,"A Russian news agency has published and then deleted an article prematurely praising Russia's success in invading Ukraine.
It applauds Russian President Vladimir Putin for solving the Ukraine ""problem"", saying that ""Ukraine has returned to Russia"" through military action. It suggests the author anticipated a rapid victory and the piece was published prematurely.
The article, published by the state-owned RIA-Novosti news agency on Saturday (26 February) and described by Christo Grozev of fact-checkers Bellingcat as ""extremely shocking, even for Kremlin standards"", was quickly deleted from its website.
Other Twitter users called it Russia's ""victory celebration"".
However, it still remains visible on the Internet Archive website, and at the time of writing it's also visible on a regional page of Russia's government-owned Sputnik news site.
A syndicated version in English entitled ""The New World Order"" can also be seen on the website of Pakistan's Frontier Post.
Many Twitter users presumed the editorial piece was intended for publication after a swift Russian victory in Ukraine.
In it, contributor Petr Akopov claims that Russia is returning to lead a new world order, while making good the ""terrible catastrophe"" that was the end of the Soviet Union in 1991.
It is headlined ""The arrival of Russia in a new world"", but the Russian word for ""arrival"" (nastuplenie) can also mean ""attack"".
Mr Akopov justifies the ""virtual civil war"" as ""Russia restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together"".
Moscow is drawing together ""Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians (Ukrainians)"", he says, suggesting a Russian plan to increase its sphere of influence.
The architect of this act of reunion is, of course, Mr Putin, who is praised for taking action now, rather than leaving the situation to be resolved in the future.
""Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations,"" the article says.
It concludes by claiming that the military action ""is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world"", which has put the Anglo-Saxons of Europe and the US in their place.
""Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over,"" it claims.
Some claims on social media say that the timing of the article's publication - exactly 08:00 on Saturday - shows that it was planned in advance by those who thought that the war would reach a swift conclusion.
The publication of this article marks a change of Russian tone on the invasion in the country's state-controlled media, mentioning its motivation of returning Ukraine to ""its natural state as part of the Russian world"".
But with the invasion seemingly going much slower than expected, this new narrative looks like it's been quietly shelved.
Instead, state-run media in Russia continues to tell its audiences that the invasion is a ""special military operation"" to support the Russian-backed rebels in the east of Ukraine, and to ""de-Nazify"" the country.
There's virtually no mention of casualties or military setbacks, while large chunks of TV schedules on state channels are given over to talk shows justifying military action.
Only relatively small outlets with very small audiences are reporting the reality of events, while Russia's media regulator Roskomnadzor has restricted Russian users' access to Facebook and Twitter, in what it says is a protest against ""censorship"" by the social media platforms.

Our live coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine has moved here.
From CNN's Inke Kappeler 


German Chancellor Olaf Scholz rejected the accusations made by Russia that Ukraine was preparing to use a “so-called dirty bomb"" — calling them baseless, according to a readout of the call released by the German Chancellery on Monday.
In a phone call on between the two leaders, Scholz agreed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that independent investigations by the International Atomic Energy Agency would remove any doubt about Ukraine-initiated preparation of such a bomb, the readout said.
The IAEA said Monday that investigators had begun their inspection of two locations that Russia said Ukraine was using to develop such bombs. Agency’s chief Rafael Grossi is expected to provide his initial conclusions later this week.
Scholz also said that Germany will continue to provide “concrete political, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine” as well as “defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity, including in arms deliveries.”

From CNN's Tim Lister


President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday that repair work continues after Russian missile strikes on Ukraine's power infrastructure — and that a majority of the missiles fired had been brought down by air defenses.
""If someone in the Kremlin has listened to their crazy propagandists and decided that the darkness in Ukraine will help pressure Ukrainians, then let them not be surprised with their losses when they see how Ukrainians are conducting ""negotiations"" in the dark,"" he added.
Zelensky repeated the military's statement that of the 55 cruise missiles fired, 45 were shot down. 
""For every ten hits, the terrorists have to expend at least four times more missiles,"" Zelensky said. ""Russia's performance on drones is even worse, including those supplied by their Iranian allies.""
""The wreckage of a Russian missile that fell on the territory of Moldova only reminds us how important it is to defend ourselves together against this evil,"" Zelensky added.
Some context: Several houses were damaged Monday in the Moldovan village of Naslavcea – on the border with Ukraine – after a missile shot down by the Ukrainian forces hit the northern part of the village, according to the Interior Ministry of Moldova.
From CNN's Xiaofei Xu 
Experts from the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog agency have started their inspection at two locations that Russia said Ukraine was using to develop ""dirty bombs,"" a statement from the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Monday. 
Russia has repeatedly claimed that Ukraine is conspiring to use a “dirty bomb” — a device that contains nuclear materials along with traditional explosives — in what Moscow says would be a false flag operation to blame Russia. 
The claims have been rejected by Ukraine as well as its Western allies, including the US and the UK.  
The inspections are being carried out after a written request from Ukraine following Moscow’s claims, the statement said, adding that the agency’s chief Rafael Grossi would provide his “initial conclusions” later this week. 
From CNN's Julia Kesaieva


Russians continue to evacuate civilians from Kherson while fortifying their defenses in the region, a Ukrainian official said. 
""Russian occupiers continue to evacuate the civilian population of Kherson and the west bank of Kherson region. In addition, they are looting all the property they can find — from equipment to ambulances,"" said Serhii Khlan, a member of the Kherson Regional Council, said during a Monday briefing. 
Ukrainian forces have been making advances along the west bank of the river Dnipro. 
Khlan said the looted property was being taken to the town of Skadovsk, close to Crimea. CNN is unable to verify the claim.
He also said that the Russians were building fortifications further south along the east bank, close to where the Dnipro empties into the Black Sea.

From CNN's Katharina Krebs
The civilian evacuation zone in the partially Russian-occupied Kherson region has been expanded to 15 kilometers from the river Dnipro, the region’s pro-Russian proxy leader announced on Monday. 
""This applies to the settlements of the Nova Kakhovka urban district, Golopristansky, Aleshkinsky, Kakhovka, Gornostaevsky, Velikolepetikhsky and Verkhnerogachiksky municipal districts,"" he said.
Saldo claimed that the Kherson region remains under ""the reliable protection of the Russian army,” and that the decision to expand the evacuation zone will create ""a layered defense that will make it possible to repel the attack of Ukrainian troops and protect civilians.""
The Ukrainian leaders-in-exile of the Kherson region have accused the Russian-backed leaders of drumming up “hysteria” to intimidate the population.

From CNN’s Katharina Krebs 
Russian energy giant Gazprom was allowed to inspect the site of the explosions that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday.
""Today, (Gazprom CEO Alexey) Miller reported in the morning that it had been examined. By the way, Gazprom was allowed to inspect the site of the explosion,"" Putin told journalists at a news conference following meetings with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Russian city of Sochi.
Putin described how the pipe that was torn out was “bent at 90 degrees and thrown as far as 40 meters to the side, just in the direction of Nord Stream 2, which also turned out to be damaged, apparently by this explosion and fragments, the remains of this pipe.""
""So this is an obvious terrorist attack, and it's hard for us to control it, because it's all in the special economic zone of Denmark, Sweden, then beyond Germany,"" the Russian president said. 
More background: In September, European countries raced to investigate unexplained leaks in two Russian gas pipelines running under the Baltic Sea near Sweden and Denmark. 
Both pipelines have been flashpoints in an escalating energy war between European capitals and Moscow that has pummelled major Western economies, sent gas prices soaring and sparked a hunt for alternative energy supplies.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Moscow's fresh onslaught on Ukraine earlier in the day was partly in response to the attack on Russia's fleet in the Crimean city of Sevastopol on Saturday, which he blamed on Kyiv.
When asked by a reporter if Monday's strikes were a response to Saturday's drone attacks in Crimea, Putin said: 
Russia launched missile attacks on infrastructure facilities in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, leaving parts of the capital without electricity and water. 
When asked about the possibility of peace talks with Ukraine, Putin said: ""In order to start making proposals at the talks, the talks need to take place first. And laying out your negotiating position on the table in advance is not always advisable in order to achieve your national goals."" 
""But in order to achieve agreements, you need to sit down at the negotiating table and negotiate,"" he added.
The Russian leader blamed Ukraine for throwing ""in the bin"" the agreement reached in Istanbul earlier this year while signing the Black Sea grain export deal. 
""And now, in general, they forbid themselves to talk with us. Well, how can we now discuss possible agreements if there is not even a desire on the other side to talk to us? We will wait, maybe some necessary conditions will ripen. And our goodwill is known — it is not subject to any changes and doubts,"" he added. 
From CNN’s Katharina Krebs and Sugam Pokharel in London
President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Russia was suspending but “not ending” its participation in the vital Black Sea grain export deal with Ukraine.
Russia's decision came after ""the creation of a threat"" to the humanitarian corridor, Putin said at a news conference following meetings with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan in the southern Russian city of Sochi.
Russia on Saturday announced that it was suspending its involvement in the UN-brokered agreement viewed as key to addressing the global food shortage. 
Moscow said it was leaving the deal after blaming Ukraine for a drone attack on Crimea on Saturday. Kyiv accused Russia of inventing “fictitious terrorist attacks” and using the deal as “blackmail.”
“The whole process of exporting grain from Ukraine's territory was organized under the pretext of ensuring the interests of the poorest countries. And we did this precisely in the interests of the poorest countries,"" Putin said.

Our live coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine has moved here.
From CNN's Jonny Hallam
President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia demanding security guarantees from Ukraine demonstrates the failure of its invasion after eight months of fighting.
In his nightly address on Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader said: ""252 days ago, Russia demanded security guarantees from the United States of America. After eight months of Russia's so-called 'special operation,' the Kremlin is demanding security guarantees from Ukraine. These are indeed striking changes."" 
""It shows both the failure of Russian aggression and how strong we are when we remain united,"" Zelensky added.
Earlier on Wednesday, Russia resumed its participation in the UN-brokered grain deal that it had left days earlier, saying it had received written security guarantees from Ukraine on demilitarizing the maritime corridor.
In televised comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, “having received the necessary guarantees from the Ukrainian side that the humanitarian route will not be used for military purposes, Russia resumes the implementation of the grain deal."" 
From CNN's Jennifer Hansler
The Biden administration approved the potential sale of approximately $535 million in Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems to Finland, the State Department announced Wednesday.
The approval comes as Finland awaits approval by Turkey and Hungary to join NATO. Helsinki’s move to join the defense alliance was prompted by Russia’s war in Ukraine — Finland shares shares an 800-mile border with Russia. 
“Finland intends to use these defense articles and services to increase its national stock, bolstering the land and air defense capabilities in Europe’s northern flank,” it said. “The increased national stock is critical to Finland’s defense and deterrence due to the deteriorated security situation in Europe.” 
From CNN's Julia Kesaieva
Ukrainian officials say that the military has struck an important target in the southern region Kherson, as the pro-Russian authorities continue to press civilians to leave.
Serhii Khlan, member of the Kherson Regional Council, said that Ukrainian forces hit Russian air defense systems close to the stadium in Kherson city. Those systems have also been used to shell Mykolaiv, sometimes with devastating effect.
Khlan posted a photograph purportedly showing the ""remains of the equipment.""
Khlan said there had also been further hits in the area of the Antonivskyi bridge, where Russian forces and the pro-Russian administration have been operating ferries and pontoon bridges to resupply the west bank, where thousands of Russian troops remain.
He said that in the city of Kakhovka —on the east bank of the river Dnipro — the three streets closest to the river were being forcibly evacuated. He said the Russians ""in the city are digging in, setting up concrete trenches.""
Khlan said the Russians ""are digging in on the east bank, preparing for defense, thinking that this make our offensive impossible. But the resistance movement and the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to fight.""
Khlan repeated what other Ukrainian officials have asserted: that the Russian-backed authorities have left the city of Kherson — which is on the west bank — to set up office in the city of Skadovsk, much closer to Crimea. 
""As for the urgent and mandatory ""evacuation"" called for by the Russians, our people are not going to go anywhere. If the locals did not have the opportunity to go to the de-occupied [Ukrainian-held] territory or decided to stay at home, they definitely do not want to go to Russia,"" Khlan said.

From CNN's Jonny Hallam and Olga Voitovych 


Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Iran has been informed through diplomatic channels of the consequences of Tehran sending new weapon deliveries of attack drones and ballistic missiles to Russia. 
Kuleba said at a news conference in Kyiv that ""the threat is real"" of reported new weapon deliveries from Iran. 
On Tuesday, CNN reported that Iran is preparing to send approximately 1,000 additional weapons, including surface-to-surface short range ballistic missiles and more attack drones, to Russia to use in its war against Ukraine, according to officials from a Western country that closely monitors Iran’s weapons program.
""A much wiser decision for Iran would be to completely curtail its military cooperation, supply to Russia of any weapons used against Ukraine,"" Kuleba added. 
Iran has repeatedly denied sending weapons to Russia despite clear evidence to the contrary. 
From CNN's Yulia Kesaieva
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday said he thanked Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for his ""active participation in preserving the grain deal"" after Russia said it would rejoin the agreement.
Zelensky said in a Telegram post that during the phone call with Erdoğan, he also thanked his Turkish counterpart for his ""strong support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine.""
Zelensky said that they also discussed ""further steps for the return of our captured political prisoners.""
""Turkey's support is important for us in this matter,"" he added. 
From CNN's Jonny Hallam
Russia on Wednesday said its nuclear doctrine will only permit the use of atomic weapons in a way that is defensive in nature and that the strict guidelines ""pursue solely defensive goals.""
A statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation said the Russian military is ""strictly and consistently guided by the tenet that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.""
""Russian doctrinal approaches in this sphere are defined with utmost accuracy"" and do not allow room for ""expansive interpretation,"" the ministry said.
The statement comes amid a recent increase in concern among United States and Western officials that Russia was considering using a tactical nuclear weapon on Ukraine.
On Wednesday, CNN reported that Russian military officials have discussed how and under what conditions Russia would use a tactical nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine, according to a US intelligence assessment described to CNN by multiple sources who have read it.
The Russian foreign ministry in its statement said that it reaffirms its commitment to a joint statement signed on Jan. 3 by China, Russia, France, the UK and the US on preventing nuclear war and arms races. 
""We urge other states of the 'nuclear five' to demonstrate in practice their willingness to work on solving this top-priority task and to give up the dangerous attempts to infringe on vital interests of each other while balancing on the brink of a direct armed conflict and encouraging provocations with weapons of mass destruction, which can lead to catastrophic consequences,"" the ministry said.
From CNN's Eve Brennan and Chris Liakos 



United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres “warmly welcomes” Russia resuming participation in the Black Sea grain deal, his spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said on Wednesday. 
“The Secretary-General warmly welcomes the announcement from the Russian Federation on its resumed participation in the implementation of the Black Sea Grain Initiative to facilitate the safe navigation for exports of grain, foodstuffs and fertilizer from Ukraine,” Dujarric said in a news release.
Dujarric said that Guterres is “grateful” for the diplomatic efforts of Turkey, thanking “UN Coordinator, Amir Abdulla, and his team for their work to keep this vital food supply line open.”
“The Secretary-General continues his engagement with all actors towards the renewal and full implementation of the Initiative, and he also remains committed to removing the remaining obstacles to the exports of Russian food and fertilizer,” Dujarric added.  
From CNN's Natasha Bertrand, Katie Bo Lillis and Zachary Cohen


Russian military officials have discussed how and under what conditions Russia would use a tactical nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine, according to a US intelligence assessment described to CNN by multiple sources who have read it.
The assessment, drafted by the National Intelligence Council, is not a high confidence product and is not raw intelligence but rather analysis, multiple people who have read it told CNN. For that reason, some officials believe the conversations reflected in the document may have been taken out of context, and do not necessarily indicate that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon.
The US has still not seen any signs that Russian President Vladimir Putin has decided to take the drastic step of using one, officials said, and Putin is not believed to have been involved in the discussions described in the NIC product.
But others within the administration who have viewed the document have reacted with concern, because it provides a rare window into conversations between senior Russian generals and reveals their intensifying frustration about Russia's losses on the battlefield in Ukraine. That frustration could turn into desperation, some officials fear. There are also questions about whether Russia's self-declared annexation of eastern Ukraine earlier this year means Russia is willing to take more extreme measures to protect that territory.
Some more context: The US has also been watching Russia's actions around the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, which Ukrainian forces are trying to take back from Russian forces in a counteroffensive. In recent weeks, Russian officials have ordered the city to be evacuated, and the US is concerned that if Ukraine drives the Russians out in a humiliating defeat, it could be the kind of trigger that would lead Putin to resort to tactical nukes. It's among the scenarios envisioned by the intelligence assessment, although officials emphasized that Kherson is not the sole focus of the product.
The New York Times first reported on the intelligence assessment. But the internal divisions over the quality of the intelligence and how to interpret it has not been previously reported.

This has been CNBC's live blog covering updates on the war in Ukraine. [Follow the latest updates here.]
Ukraine's power shortages, resulting from Russia's repeated strikes on the country's energy infrastructure, are becoming more acute as colder weather sets in.
Warning that ""cold weather can kill,"" the World Health Organization said while 10 million Ukrainians remain without power, many face life-threatening conditions as temperatures fall — to as low as -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. It is believed that another two to three million people could leave their homes to find warmth and safety over winter.
The recently de-occupied city of Kherson is feeling power and water shortages acutely, with Ukrainian officials telling residents, and particularly women, children and the elderly and vulnerable, to leave the city and de-occupied parts of the wider Kherson region over winter. 
The government is offering free evacuation to Kryvyi Rih, Mykolaiv and Odesa, with possible further movement to Kirovohrad, Khmelnytskyi or western regions of Ukraine, Ukraine's deputy prime minister said Monday.
The Treasury Department issued new guidance regarding the maritime transport of Russian oil ahead of a planned price cap in early December.
The guidance complements the U.K.'s newly-released policies in outlining how domestic service providers can continue carrying seaborne oil while complying with the strategic price cap on Russian oil devised by G7 countries, the E.U. and Australia. 
""We're taking these steps to make it as easy as possible for market participants to implement the price cap policy as of Dec. 5 consistent with the coalition's goals of allowing Russians to keep foreign oil (in) flow while lowering the Kremlin's revenues,"" a senior Treasury official said.
The price cap is intended to deprive Russia of a funding source to continue its war against Ukraine. It goes into effect on Dec. 5.

The European Union has sent another $2.5 billion to help Ukraine, according to the country's prime minister, Denys Shmyhal.
Shmyhal said in a tweet on Tuesday that the EU ""disbursed €2.5 billion [around $2.57 billion] in macro-financial assistance.""
Tweet:
The massive infusion of cash is the latest effort by the EU to help Ukraine fight off the Russian invasion. 
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently announced that the EU will provide up to $18 billion in financial aid in 2023 as the country takes on Russia.

Iran may be guilty of crimes against humanity as a result of producing weapons for Russia that reportedly will be used in Ukraine, said British Ambassador to the U.S. Karen Pierce in an interview.
""Even at this late stage, I do think the Iranians need to contemplate how they may be guilty of crimes against humanity by supplying these weapons to the Russians,"" Pierce told Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC.
The Washington Post reported that Iran has agreed to start to manufacture hundreds of unmanned drones on Russian soil.
It is expected that those weapons to be used in the conflict with Ukraine.

A bipartisan group of 16 senators asked the Biden administration to reverse its decision against sending advanced drones to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion. 
In a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the senators argued that the U.S. should provide Ukraine with MQ-1C Grey Eagles, armed drones that can fly for more than 24 hours at a time. 
The senators wrote that they believe these drones will help stabilize Ukrainian defenses, increase their unmanned capabilities and drive the war in Ukraine's favor.
Ukraine's request for drones was declined by the Pentagon earlier this month.
""This system's operational attributes – availability, lethality, survivability, and exportability – complement existing weapon systems used by the Ukrainians and will increase the lethality of the Ukrainian military,"" the lawmakers wrote. 
They requested an official response from the Biden administration by Nov. 30.

Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen praised an additional disbursement of $4.5 billion from the U.S. government to aid Ukraine in its ongoing defense against Russia.
The disbursement brings total U.S. direct budget support to $13 billion in grants, Yellen said in a statement. 
She said that the aid, in combination with historic sanctions and other targeted measures, will help ""weaken [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's war machine.""
The funds will begin being disbursed ""in the coming weeks and help the Government of Ukraine defend against Russia's illegal war by bolstering economic stability and supporting core government services, including wages for hospital workers, government employees, and teachers as well as social assistance for the elderly and vulnerable,"" she said in her statement.
""Combined with our security assistance and the immense bravery of the Ukrainian people, these funds are a critical tool in Ukraine's resistance to Putin's unprovoked invasion,"" Yellen said.

The Associated Press fired national security reporter James LaPorta over a retracted article that incorrectly had said Russian missiles were responsible for the deaths of two people in neighboring Poland, The Daily Beast reported.
The Nov. 15 story had circulated widely among media outlets before the AP issued a correction Wednesday, which reported that the deaths in the Polish town of Przewodow near the Ukraine border in reality involved Russian-made missiles which were fired by Ukraine in defense against Russia. 
A Russian attack on Poland, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, could have prompted intervention from NATO in the Russian-Ukraine conflict. 
The initial missile claim by LaPorta had been attributed to ""a senior U.S. intelligence official."" 
The AP says it requires more than one source when sourcing is anonymous unless ""material comes from an authoritative figure who provides information so detailed that there is no question of its accuracy.""
Internal communications showed some confusion over who approved LaPorta's source, The Washington Post reported.
LaPorta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNBC. Lauren Easton, vice president of corporate communications for the AP, did not answer directly when asked if LaPorta had been terminated. 
Easton said in a statement that the news service outlet abided by ""rigorous editorial standards and practices"" critical to its mission. 
""When our standards are violated, we must take the steps necessary to protect the integrity of the news report. We do not make these decisions lightly, nor are they based on isolated incidents,"" she said.

The head of Ukraine's national power grid said that the damage left by Russia's missile attacks has devasted the nation's power generation capacity.
""The scale of destruction is colossal. In Ukraine, there is a power generation deficit. We cannot generate as much energy as consumers can use,"" said Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, CEO of Ukrenergo National Energy Company, 
Kudrytskyi said that a recent massive missile attack by Russia on the nation's power grids was the  ""biggest one in Ukrainian history.""
""More than 100 heavy missiles were launched at the Ukrainian power grid infrastructure,"" he said.
The Russian attacks on Ukraine's power grid have left many regions of the country struggling and turning to power generators for assistance.

Russian state gas giant Gazprom threatened to reduce gas supplies to Moldova via Ukraine, accusing Kyiv of holding onto supplies destined for its neighbor.
In a statement on Telegram, Gazprom said the volume of gas it was supplying to the Sudzha gas measuring station ""for transit to Moldova, through the territory of Ukraine, exceeds the physical volume transmitted at the border of Ukraine with Moldova.""
Gazprom said its Moldovan customer, Moldovagaz, had paid for part of its supply for November on Monday but it said Ukraine had withheld 52.52 million cubic meters of gas meant for the country.
If the transit imbalance continued, Gazprom said, it will begin reducing gas supply to the Sudzha [gas measuring station] for transit through Ukraine from Nov. 28, saying it would reduce supplies equivalent to those that were allegedly being ""underdelivered.""
Ukraine and Moldova have not yet responded to the claims. CNBC has contacted Ukraine's energy ministry for comment, and Moldovagaz, and is awaiting a response.

Ukraine's president held a meeting Tuesday with the head of the Ukrainian armed forces and other senior military commanders and government officials to discuss three key issues facing Ukraine's forces on the frontline.
Firstly, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Telegram, the priority ""is to provide our army with equipment and weapons."" 
""The second is the protection of energy infrastructure facilities,"" he said, while the third key issue was to ""ensure the high-quality operation of infrastructure facilities throughout the winter."" 
Ukraine faces an uphill struggle to keep the lights on with a significant proportion of its energy infrastructure damaged or destroyed by Russian attacks. Zelenskyy said maintaining operational infrastructure would ""not be an easy walk"" but that Ukraine would persevere.

Russian shelling hit a humanitarian aid distribution center in the town of Orihiv in southeastern Ukraine on Tuesday, killing a volunteer and wounding two women, the regional governor said.
Oleksandr Starukh, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, gave no further details of the attack on Orihiv, about 110 km (70 miles) east of the site of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station which has been shelled in the past few days.
Russia and Ukraine accused each other of firing the shells that fell near reactors and damaged a radioactive waste storage building at the plant. 
""Russian terrorists are shelling humanitarian delivery points, continuing nuclear blackmail - a pitiful tactic of military losers,"" Andriy Yermak, chief of the presidential staff, wrote on the Telegram messaging app.
""Well, for every such action there is a Ukrainian counteraction,"" he added.

The Russian Orthodox Church said on Tuesday that searches conducted by Ukrainian security services at an Orthodox monastery in the capital Kyiv were an ""act of intimidation.""
""Like many other cases of persecution of believers in Ukraine since 2014, this act of intimidation of believers is almost certain to go unnoticed by those who call themselves the international human rights community,"" Vladimir Legoida, a spokesperson for the church said, Reuters reported.
Ukraine said it carried out the searches at the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra complex as part of counter-intelligence measures, and that they were conducted within the law. Russia invaded Ukraine in February. 
Patriarch Kirill, the head of Russia's church, has given his support for what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine.

Ukrainian officials in the southern province of Zaporizhzhia say the region continues to experience Russian shelling with 58 houses and apartments destroyed over the past day.
The Zaporizhzhia Regional Military Administration said on Telegram that Russian forces had shelled multiple settlements in the region, with Zaporizhzhia's police force receiving multiple reports on the destruction of houses and apartments and unspecified ""infrastructure objects"" as a result of shelling by Russian military personnel.
Officials said 78 people had been evacuated from the region during the past day, including 11 children. CNBC was unable to immediately verify the information.

Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk called on the residents of the recently de-occupied part of Kherson to evacuate for the winter.
""The government offers free evacuation to Kryvyi Rih, Mykolaiv and Odesa, with possible further movement to Kirovohrad, Khmelnytskyi or western regions of Ukraine,"" she wrote on her Telegram account.
She directed her call to women with children, the elderly, the sick and those with reduced mobility in particular, saying that ""given the difficult security situation in the city and infrastructure problems, you can evacuate for the winter to safer regions of the country.""
Displaced people will be provided with free accommodation in shelters, humanitarian aid, food and medical support, she said.
Vereshchuk is not the first to call on people to evacuate the region, a significant part of which was liberated after a Russian withdrawal earlier in November from the western bank of the Dnipro river to the opposite bank. Russian forces gathered there have been shelling Kherson since, however.
Other Ukrainian officials in Kherson have also warned civilians there that it's safer to evacuate the region now because of the dangers posed by Russian shelling. The region has received humanitarian aid in the form of blankets, warm clothes, food, hygiene products and medicine.

The World Health Organization has expressed concerns over deteriorating living conditions in Ukraine, warning that ""cold weather can kill"" and that it expects millions more could flee their homes in search of warmth and safety.
Hans Kluge, WHO's regional director for Europe, warned Monday that ""this winter will be life-threatening for millions of people in Ukraine"" amid continuing attacks on health and energy infrastructure.
""The devastating energy crisis, the deepening mental health emergency, constraints on humanitarian access and the risk of viral infections will make this winter a formidable test for the Ukraine health system and the Ukrainian people, but also for the world and its commitment to support Ukraine."" 
Repeated Russian attacks on energy facilities across Ukraine mean hundreds of hospitals and health-care facilities are no longer fully operational and are lacking fuel, water and electricity to meet basic needs, the WHO warned.
Kluge said there's a high risk that alternative and potentially toxic fuels will be used as desperate families try to stay warm this winter.
""Many will be forced to turn to alternative heating methods like burning charcoal or wood or using generators fueled by diesel or electric heaters. These bring health risks, including exposure to toxic substances that are harmful for children, older people and those with respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, as well as accidental burns and injuries,"" he said.

There are ""no immediate safety or security concerns"" at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant following heavy shelling throughout the weekend,  the International Atomic Energy Agency said.
However, while key equipment remained intact, the assessment team found widespread damage across the site.
""This is a major cause of concern as it clearly demonstrates the sheer intensity of the attacks on one of the world's largest nuclear power plants,"" IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said in a statement after the agency conducted an investigation of the site.
Areas of the plant damaged by the strikes included a pressurized air pipeline, the main road to reactors and condensate storage tanks, resulting in non-radioactive leakage. Operating and maintenance staff are already repairing some of the damage and plant personnel are cleaning up the site, the IAEA said.
Grossi has repeatedly warned against fighting near the site, most recently saying that whoever was responsible for the attacks was ""playing with fire.""
The renewed attacks on and around the nuclear site have intensified Grossi's calls for a protection zone, which would prevent shelling near the plant.

One person was killed and four others injured from Russian shelling in the Kherson region, according to Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the Office of the President of Ukraine.
Despite Russia's withdrawal from Kherson earlier this month, shelling has continued in the southern Ukrainian region. same t
Over the past several months, Russia has consistently attacked civilian infrastructure, including energy systems and residential buildings. 
Ukrainian officials began evacuating civilians from Kherson and a neighboring province as infrastructure damage was deemed too critical for inhabitants to safely remain during the winter.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged NATO members to guarantee the protection of Ukraine's nuclear plants from Russian sabotage, a day after the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia plant was rocked by heavy shelling.
""All our nations are interested in not having any dangerous incidents at our nuclear facilities,"" Zelenskyy said in a video address to NATO's Parliamentary Assembly in Madrid.
""We all need guaranteed protection from Russian sabotage at nuclear facilities,"" he added.
The Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine was shelled on Saturday and Sunday, raising concern about the potential for a serious accident just 500 km (300 miles) from Chornobyl, site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986.

The NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Madrid called for the creation of a special international tribunal on Russia's aggression in Ukraine and recognized Russia as a terrorist state, according to a statement from the head of Ukraine's permanent delegation to the NATO assembly.
""All 30 NATO countries supported the proposals of our delegation,"" Yehor Chernev said in the statement. 
""Such a tribunal will make it possible to convict not only the direct perpetrators of war crimes, but also the senior leadership of the Russian Federation.""
The resolution, which also includes proposals to increase arms supplies to Ukraine, develop further steps for Ukraine's accession to NATO, and create a reparation collection mechanism, will be sent to all NATO member countries, Chernev said.
""The adoption of this resolution is an important political step that reflects the mood in Western parliamentary circles, and therefore influences the leadership of countries in decision-making,"" he said.
At the assembly, NATO Allies and the European Union also reinforced their commitment to long-term, sustained financial and military support for Ukraine.

NATO allies Poland and Germany have agreed to deploy additional Patriot missile launchers near the Polish border with Ukraine following an offer from Berlin, Poland's defense minister said on Monday.
""The German Defence Minister confirmed her willingness to deploy the Patriot launcher at the border with Ukraine,"" Mariusz Blaszczak wrote on Twitter.
""The version of the system remains to be determined, as does how quickly they will reach us and how long they will be stationed.""
Berlin offered Warsaw the Patriot missile defense system to help secure its airspace after a stray missile crashed in Poland last week, Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht told a newspaper on Sunday.
The German government had already said it would offer its eastern neighbor further help in air policing with German Eurofighters after the incident, which initially raised fears that the war in Ukraine could spill across the border.

Vladimir Putin warned that the threat of nuclear war was “on the rise” while speaking during a televised annual session of his human rights council.
Putin insisted Russia had not “gone mad” and that it saw its own nuclear arsenal as a purely defensive deterrent. He said:
We haven’t gone mad, we realise what nuclear weapons are. We have these means in more advanced and modern form than any other nuclear country, that’s an obvious fact. But we aren’t about to run around the world brandishing this weapon like a razor.
He went on to claim that Russia “could be the only guarantor of Ukraine’s territorial integrity”, adding:
It’s up to the new leaders of Ukraine.
It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand:
President Vladimir Putin has admitted that Russia’s war in Ukraine could turn into a “long-term process”. Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack.
Putin also claimed that Russia would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict, denied that Russian troops were deserting in mass from the field of battle, and claimed that the Russian military would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia.
Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Russia is attempting to “freeze” the fighting in Ukraine over the winter to prepare its forces for a renewed assault early next year. Stoltenberg urged Nato allies to continue sending weapons to Kyiv over the winter, adding that the conditions for a peaceful settlement to the war are “not there now”.
Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said 31 “suspicious packages” had been sent to Ukrainian missions in 15 countries. In the past week, Ukraine says its embassies and consultants across Europe have received “bloody” packages, some containing animal eyes, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”.
Eight people were killed by Russian shelling in the town of Kurakhove in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, according to a Ukrainian official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the presidential office, said five people were also wounded in the attack, in which a market, bus station, petrol stations and residential buildings came under fire in the town in the Donetsk region.
A road accident in the temporarily occupied eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk has left 16 people dead and several injured, according to a Russian-backed official and state media. The accident involved a minibus and a truck, whose passengers included soldiers, and took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, emergency services told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass.
Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has called on the country’s western allies to boycott Russian culture. Writing in the Guardian, Tkachenko argues that a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”.
The European Commission has proposed a ninth package of sanctions on Russia, including adding almost 200 additional individuals and entities on the sanctions list. In a statement, the head of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, accused Russia of “deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure” and of continuing to “bring deaths and devastation to Ukraine”.
The US has made clear to Ukraine its “concerns” about any escalation of the war with Russia, the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said. Kirby said the principle behind the war in Ukraine was one of sovereignty, and “unlike the Russians, we respect Ukrainian sovereignty”. Kirby’s comments came after Kyiv appeared to launch a pre-emptive strike on bombers on two Russian airbases far from the frontlines earlier this week.
The Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was “provocation towards our country”. The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over President Joe Biden’s request earlier this year.
Britain has ordered “several thousand” NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played “a decisive role” in pushing back the Russian invasion, but Labour has complained that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make.
BP should donate its “wartime profits” in Russia to the reconstruction of Ukraine or ministers should impose a special windfall tax on the oil company to force it to do so, British MPs have told parliament. The British oil supermajor has a 19.75% stake in Rosneft, one of the Kremlin’s most important oil assets and signalled its intent to exit Russia nine months ago, after Russia invaded Ukraine.
Belarus plans to move military equipment and security forces on Wednesday and Thursday in what it says are checks on its response to possible acts of terrorism, the state Belta news agency reported. “During this period, it is planned to move military equipment and personnel of the national security forces,” the news agency cited the country’s security council as saying.
At least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office. Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said.
An Orthodox priest accused of leaking information on Ukrainian defence positions to Russia has been sentenced to 12 years in prison, according to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office. The priest from Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, had been informing the Russians about the positions of Ukrainian troops since April, it said in a statement on Telegram.
The European Commission has proposed a ninth package of sanctions on Russia, including adding almost 200 additional individuals and entities on the sanctions list.

An Orthodox priest accused of leaking information on Ukrainian defence positions to Russia has been sentenced to 12 years in prison, according to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office.
The priest from Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, had been informing the Russians about the positions of Ukrainian troops since April, it said in a statement on Telegram.
The statement read:
A priest from the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of Moscow Patriarchate in Luhansk region has been sentenced to twelve years in prison for informing the enemy about Ukrainian defense positions. The prosecutors proved in court that the priest from Lysychansk-based church assisted the Russian armed groups during hostilities against the Ukrainian army.
The priest “gathered information about the number and deployment of equipment, as well as the Ukrainian armed forces’ weapons in Sievierodonetsk and the neighbouring settlements”, it continued.
He then sent the information to Russian representatives via mobile messengers, it said, adding that Ukrainian officials discovered the priest’s phone correspondence.
President Vladimir Putin hinted at a “long conflict” in Ukraine at a meeting with members of his human rights council.
The Russian leader said further mobilisation at this stage wasn’t necessary as only 150,000 out of 300,000 mobilised troops were in combat.
He did however say he will use “all means” available and that the risk of nuclear war is on the rise.
Vladimir Putin has admitted that Russia’s war in Ukraine could turn into a “long-term process” as he sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack.
Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin claimed that Russia would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict, denied that Russian troops were deserting in mass from the field of battle, and claimed that the Russian military would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia.
But mainly the Russian president defended the “special military operation” – his preferred term for what he openly admitted was a Russian war of conquest that he compared with the territorial ambitions of former Russian tsars.
“As for the slow process of the special military operation, then, of course, it can be a long-term process,” Putin said.
But then you mentioned that new territories had appeared. This is such a significant result for Russia … The Azov Sea has become an internal Russian sea. Even Peter I had fought for access to the Azov Sea.
Russia has been forced to abandon some of those “annexed” territories, notably fleeing the city of Kherson last month due to a sweeping Ukrainian counterattack. Russia now shells the city of Kherson regularly from the other side of the Dnieper River, in effect attacking its own territory.

Here are some of the latest images we have received from Ukraine.
The US has made clear to Ukraine its “concerns” about any escalation of the war with Russia, the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said.
Kirby’s comments to reporters today came after Kyiv appeared to launch a pre-emptive strike on bombers on two Russian airbases far from the frontlines earlier this week.
Kirby said the principle behind the war in Ukraine was one of sovereignty, and “unlike the Russians, we respect Ukrainian sovereignty”.
The US has had conversations with Ukraine about the accountability of weapons systems “but in the end these are Ukrainian decisions that they have to make”, he said.
He added:
When we give them a weapons system, it belongs to them. Where they use it, how they use it, how much ammunition they use to use that system, those are Ukrainian decisions, and we respect that.
During a press conference with the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, and their Australian counterparts in Washington, the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said the US had not “encouraged nor enabled” Ukraine to strike inside Russia.
Austin, however, said the US was not stopping Ukraine from developing its own long-range strike capability.
Eight people were killed by Russian shelling in the town of Kurakhove in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, according to a Ukrainian official.
Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the presidential office, said five people were also wounded in the attack, in which a market, bus station, petrol stations and residential buildings came under fire in the town in the Donetsk region.

Writing on Telegram, Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russian shelling killed at least six people and set buildings ablaze in the town.
He wrote:
Terrorists attacked the peaceful town of Kurakhove. Terrorists are inhuman. And they will be held to account for it.”
BP should donate its “wartime profits” in Russia to the reconstruction of Ukraine or ministers should impose a special windfall tax on the oil company to force it to do so, MPs have told parliament.
The British oil supermajor has a 19.75% stake in Rosneft, one of the Kremlin’s most important oil assets and signalled its intent to exit Russia nine months ago, after Russia invaded Ukraine.
The company took a £18.7bn hit by writing off the shareholding from its books, but still owns the stock in the Russian state-controlled firm.
In a parliamentary debate on Wednesday, MPs from all parties put pressure on the government to ensure BP completely left the country.
An analysis by Global Witness shows that a dividend Rosneft has offered BP is worth an estimated £580m, or the equivalent of a third of the UK’s direct aid to Ukraine this year.
The Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge, who raised an urgent question on the matter, told the Commons on Wednesday:
It is utterly shameful that a large, publicly listed British company profits from the sale of oil that is funding Putin’s war.
BP must either voluntarily donate the entirety of its Russian dividends to the reconstruction of Ukraine, or the government must take action to force them to do so.
The Guardian revealed last week that Oleg Ustenko, the chief economic adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has written to BP’s chief executive, Bernard Looney, to demand it cuts ties with Rosneft.

It’s just past 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand:
President Vladimir Putin has said Russia will “defend ourselves with all the means at our disposal” and warned that the threat of nuclear war is “on the rise”.

The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said it had not “enabled” Ukraine to carry out strikes inside Russia, after a spate of drone attacks on military-linked facilities deep within Russian territory. Kyiv did not directly claim responsibility but neither did it criticise the action, which killed three people and damaged long-range bombers and a fuel depot, according to reports from Russia.
Britain has ordered “several thousand” NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played “a decisive role” in pushing back the Russian invasion, but Labour has complained that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make.
Iran has so far not delivered ballistic missiles to Russia and may not do so, a senior Ukrainian presidential adviser has said. Mykhailo Podolyak also told the Guardian that Russian forces had run short of their first batch of Iranian drones – and only had enough of their own cruise missiles in their stockpile for “two or three” more mass strikes against Ukraine.

Vladimir Putin warned that the threat of nuclear war was “on the rise” while speaking during a televised annual session of his human rights council.
Putin insisted Russia had not “gone mad” and that it saw its own nuclear arsenal as a purely defensive deterrent. He said:
We haven’t gone mad, we realise what nuclear weapons are. We have these means in more advanced and modern form than any other nuclear country, that’s an obvious fact. But we aren’t about to run around the world brandishing this weapon like a razor.
He went on to claim that Russia “could be the only guarantor of Ukraine’s territorial integrity”, adding:
It’s up to the new leaders of Ukraine.
Vladimir Putin has said Russia will “defend ourselves with all the means at our disposal” in what he described as a “struggle for our national interests” against the west.
Putin said western rights organisations viewed his country as “a second-class country that has no right to exist at all” during a televised annual session of his human rights council. He said:
There can be only one answer from our side – a consistent struggle for our national interests. We will do just that. And let no one count on anything else.
He continued:
We will do this by various ways and means. First of all, of course, we will focus on peaceful means, but if nothing else remains, we will defend ourselves with all the means at our disposal.
The Russian leader said his army’s “special military operation” in Ukraine could be a “long process”, but he saw no need to mobilise additional soldiers at this point.
Out of the 300,000 reservists who were called up to fight in Russia’s partial military mobilisation in September and October, 150,000 were now deployed in Ukraine, Putin said.
Of those, 77,000 were in combat units and the remainder performing defensive functions, he said.
Britain has ordered “several thousand” NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year, prompting complaints from Labour that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make.
The Ministry of Defence announced a £230m contract with Saab, the prime contractor, to make 500 in 2023 and thousands more between 2024 and 2026, demonstrating how long it can take to replenish stocks depleted by gifts to Ukraine.
Britain was one of the earliest weapons donors to Ukraine, announcing it would send over the first batch of NLAWs in January, a month before the Russian invasion. It has since donated about 7,000, although exact figures are not available.
NLAWs helped Ukraine stop the Russian advance on Kyiv in February and March, with their simplicity of use praised by the Ukrainian military. The shoulder-mounted bazookas have a range of 50 to 800m and can simply be pointed at an oncoming tank.
Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played “a decisive role” in pushing back the Russian invasion. “We are continuing to fulfil our commitment to Nato by ensuring our armed forces will receive a steady supply of these weapons over the coming years,” he said.
The NLAWs will be assembled in Belfast by Thales, and the minister highlighted the contribution the contract would make in supporting British jobs.
But Labour complained about the length of time taken to sign off the deal. John Healey, the shadow defence secretary, said: “287 days after Putin’s invasion, ministers have finally got their act together.”
He said the first new NLAWs “still won’t be delivered until two years after the invasion”, and added: “It’s not clear when the MoD will sign contracts to restock other weapons and ammunition needed for the British army and to support Ukraine.”
Britain has committed £2.3bn in military aid in 2023, providing a total of 10,000 anti-tank weapons including Javelin and Brimstone missiles, NLAWs, M270 rocket artillery, 200 armoured vehicles, 28 M109 artillery guns plus almost 100,000 rounds, and 3m bullets, plus more than 25,000 sets of winter clothing.
Vladimir Putin has said there is no need for an additional call-up of Russian reservists to fight in Ukraine at the moment, Reuters reported.
Putin said that of the more than 300,000 Russian reservists who were drafted in what Moscow called a “partial mobilisation” in September and October, 150,000 were deployed in the zone of what Moscow calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine.
Of those, 77,000 were in combat units and the remainder were performing defensive functions, he said.
The US has been very clear with Ukraine about accountability over weapons systems and its concerns over escalation of the war with Russia, the White House national security spokesperson John Kirby said on Wednesday.
“We have been consistent on our concerns over escalation. We have not encouraged them to do that,” Kirby said, after apparent Ukrainian drone strikes on two airbases deep inside Russia.
In his office in Kyiv city hall, the mayor, Vitali Klitschko, is planning for the worst and hoping for the best, Peter Beaumont writes.
The previous day, in the middle of the sixth mass Russian missile strike against Ukrainian cities that had sent Kyiv’s resident to the bomb shelters and metro stations, no rockets had made it through to hit the capital.
On the mayor’s desk is a newspaper he has had produced and distributed around the city in recent days. Bearing his name, and the headline “We will overcome and win”, it lists all the emergency services in Kyiv that will be available in case of what should be unthinkable but isn’t: the failure of all power and services to a city of 3 million in the depths of Ukraine’s winter.
Across three densely printed pages are details of supermarkets with generators that will work in that emergency, the post offices and banks, and arrangements for public transit.
It lists the 45 underground metro stations that will remain open as shelters and provide phone charging and internet, as well as tips for surviving a prolonged blackout.
“It’s for the worst-case scenario,” says Klitschko, a former world champion boxer turned politician, picking up the paper.
We need to tell people what they need to do if the situation becomes critical and they don’t have internet and connection to media.
Life in the city can often seem largely normal, outside of the massive airstrikes that have been taking place, often weekly, since 20 October. Restaurants are busy and the streets are jammed with traffic at close to prewar levels, but with the first snow on the ground and the temperature hitting -8C this week, life in the capital is also overshadowed by the risk of a humanitarian crisis.
“Thanks to our military, they knocked out all the missiles fired at Kyiv yesterday,” says Klitschko.
But it was only two weeks ago we came close to a total blackout. Then the temperature was above freezing, but imagine the same situation if it happened now when it is close to -10 outside and with no electricity water, or heating. The consequences would be disastrous.

At least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks after President Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office.
The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) documented summary executions and attacks in dozens of towns across three regions, and warned the actual number of victims in the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions was likely to be much higher.
The report covered the beginning of Moscow’s invasion on 24 February until early April, and gathered evidence from 102 towns and villages in Ukraine.
It said:
The acts in question were committed by Russian armed forces in control of these areas and led to the deaths of 441 civilians (341 men, 72 women, 20 boys and 8 girls).
Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report said. Moscow has repeatedly denied targeting civilians in what it calls a “special military operation”.
In a statement, the UN’s high commissioner for human rights, Volker Türk, said:
There are strong indications that the summary executions documented in the report constitute the war crime of wilful killing.
Overall in the war through 4 December, the OHCHR said it had counted 6,702 civilian deaths, and that its monitoring includes violations by all parties.","(2022, 12, 7)","... 2022.

This is CNBC's live blog tracking developments on the war in Ukraine. See below for the latest updates. 
Russia warned the U.S. that if it sends Patriot missile systems to Ukraine it will consider the move a provocation that could lead to ""unpredictable consequences.""
The Biden administration is finalizing plans to send a Patriot missile system to Ukraine, three defense officials told NBC News earlier this week. The surface-to-air defense system would help Ukraine repel Russian aerial attacks.
The Russian embassy in Washington said in a statement on Telegram Wednesday that sending the Patriot missile system would be considered ""provocative.""
In his nightly address Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian forces were destroying ""everything in front of them."" He added that ""city after city"" in Donbas in eastern Ukraine was being destroyed.
""There is no calm on the front line. There is nothing easy and simple. Every day and every meter is fought for extremely hard,"" Zelenskyy said in a nightly address on his Telegram channel.
The Pentagon will expand military combat training for Ukrainian forces, using the slower winter months to instruct larger units in more complex battle skills, U.S. officials said.
The U.S. has already trained about 3,100 Ukrainian troops on how to use and maintain certain weapons and other equipment, including howitzers, armored vehicles and the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS. But senior military leaders for months have discussed expanding that training, touting the need to improve the ability of Ukraine's company- and battalion-sized units to move and coordinate attacks across the battlefield.
A battalion can include as many as 800 troops; a company is much smaller, with a couple hundred forces.
According to officials, the training will take place at the Grafenwoehr training area in Germany. And the aim is to use the winter months to hone the skills of the Ukrainian forces so they will be better prepared to counter any spike in Russian attacks or efforts to expand Russia's territorial gains.

The European Union said it approved a new package of sanctions aimed at ramping up pressure on Russia for its war in Ukraine.
The package, whose details have not been revealed, was approved after days of deliberations during a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's ambassadors.
The Czech Republic, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, said the package will be confirmed by written procedure on Friday. Details will then be published in the bloc's legal records.
The European Commission, the EU's executive branch, last week proposed travel bans and asset freezes on almost 200 more Russian officials and military officers as part of the new round of measures.
The targets of the latest recommended sanctions included government ministers, lawmakers, regional governors and political parties.

Four ships carrying wheat and vegetable oil have left ports in Ukraine, the organization managing agricultural exports from the country said. 
The ships are destined for India and Turkey.
The Black Sea Grain Initiative, a deal brokered in July among Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the United Nations, saw three key Ukrainian ports reopen after a Russian naval blockade stopped exports for months. More than 13.9 million tons of grain and other products have left Ukraine since the agreement took effect.
The deal among the signatories is set to expire in about three months.
— Amanda Macias
United Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths said it was unlikely the Black Sea grain deal would be expanded in the near term to include more Ukrainian ports or reduce inspection times.
Kyiv has called for an expansion of the deal with Moscow which was mediated by the United Nations and Turkey and allows Ukraine, a major global grain exporter, to ship food products from three of its Black Sea ports despite Russia's invasion.
""I don't see that happening in the next, near term,"" the U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator told Reuters in an interview in the Ukrainian capital.
""I think it would be great if it could be expanded, the more grain that gets out into the world, the better clearly from our point of view, from the world's point of view. But I don't think that's immediately likely.""

The U.S. Treasury Department announced it has sanctioned a bank owned by a Russian billionaire, along with 17 subsidiaries of Russia's second-largest bank VTB. 
The department made the move in tandem with designations the State Department issued against a prominent Russian oligarch, his associates and over 40 others linked to the Russian government. The efforts aim to limit Russian President Vladimir Putin's ability to fund Moscow's war with Ukraine.
Access to all properties and interests on U.S. soil owned by any of the sanctioned has been blocked.

Ukrainian military experts show downed drones that Russia allegedly uses for striking critical infrastructure and other targets in Ukraine during a press conference in Kyiv.
Ukraine said on Wednesday it had shot down more than a dozen drones in Moscow's latest assault on Kyiv.

U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Bridget Brink cheered the release of a U.S. citizen from Russian detention following another prisoner swap between Moscow and Kyiv.
""Great to see a U.S. citizen freed from Russia-controlled territory,"" Brink wrote on Twitter.
""Thanks to Andriy Yermak and our Ukrainian partners for their continued efforts to secure the freedom of U.S. citizens held by Russia's forces,"" she continued.
Sixty-four Ukrainian soldiers, who were captured in the Russian-held areas of Donetsk and Luhansk, and the U.S. citizen Suedi Murekezi were included in the exchange, Andriy Yermak, the head of the Ukrainian president's office, said on Telegram on Wednesday.

Russia is digging in for a long war in Ukraine and still wants to conquer the entire country, a senior Ukrainian military official said.
Brigadier General Oleksiy Gromov told a military briefing that although he did not expect Moscow to launch an attack from Belarus, Russian was training new troops on its neighbor's soil and had moved military aircraft there.
Deputy Defense Minister Hanna Malyar, at the same briefing, warned against allowing complacency to set in after recent Russian military setbacks.
Ukrainian officials have portrayed the Kremlin as desperate to reverse recent military setbacks - which included a retreat from the southern city of Kherson after months of occupation - and secure victories to justify the war to the Russian public.
The Kremlin has never fully defined the goals of its Feb. 24 invasion, which it said was partly intended to protect Russian-speakers in eastern Ukraine.

The organization in charge of exporting Ukrainian crops said 92 ships are waiting to be loaded with cargo. 
Sixty-eight loaded vessels are also awaiting inspection in Turkish territorial waters, the U.N.-led Joint Coordination Center said. 
The Black Sea Grain Initiative, a deal brokered in July among Ukraine, Russia, Turkey, and the United Nations, led to the reopening of three key Ukrainian ports after a Russian naval blockade stopped exports for months.
Since the agreement went into effect, more than 550 ships carrying 13.9 million metric tons of grain and other agricultural products have departed for destinations around the globe.
Kyiv has contended Moscow has held up inspections and delayed ship departures.

A senior U.N. official voiced optimism that there would be a breakthrough in negotiations to ease exports of Russian fertilizers to avoid food shortages next year.
Russia has complained its concerns about fertilizer exports had not been addressed when a deal for extending a Black Sea grain export agreement was agreed in November.
Low Russian fertilizer exports remained a ""major concern"" to avoid food shortages next year, said the Secretary-General of the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development, Rebeca Grynspan, a key U.N. negotiator.
""I am cautiously optimistic that we can have important progress soon,"" she told reporters in Geneva. ""We will spare no effort in trying to make this happen as we really think it is essential for avoiding a food security crisis in the world.""
She declined to give further details.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has indicated that he would only back the reopening of Russian ammonia exports, used to make fertilizer, in exchange for a prisoner swap and negotiations have since focused on this.
— Reuters
Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska thanked France for its ""solidarity"" with the Ukrainian people as Russia's war enters its eleventh month.
Zelenska went to France on Sunday. She led a Ukrainian delegation that included Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal. 
During her visit, Zelenska met with Ukrainian families who have taken temporary resident status in France.

Doctors shed their scrubs for street clothes. And one by one, the staff of the largest hospital in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine slipped away as Russian forces seized control of the city's center.
Months later, around 30 staff members from Mariupol's Hospital No. 2 have reassembled in Kyiv. Along with 30 specialists from a cardiac hospital in Kramatorsk, a Donetsk city that remains under Ukraine's control, they are opening a pared-down version of a public hospital to help displaced Ukrainians in need of care.
Much of Ukraine's medical infrastructure is going to have to be rebuilt from scratch. The World Health Organization has documented 715 attacks on health care in Ukraine during the war.
A study released last week by the Ukrainian Health Care Center found nearly 80% of the medical facilities in Mariupol alone were damaged or destroyed, or 82 out of the 106 locations the center analyzed with a combination of satellite imagery and witness testimony.
— Associated Press
Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said a decision has yet to be taken on repairs to the Nord Stream gas pipelines, which sustained damage in September.
""It has not yet come down to repairs, no decisions have been made on this matter,"" he said, according to Russian state news agency Tass.
The twin undersea Nord Stream pipelines transport critical natural gas resources from Russia to Germany. Russian state gas company Gazprom intermittently suspended the gas flows to Germany from late August, citing maintenance issues, though the move was widely believed to be in response to EU sanctions on Russia. 
After explosions hit the pipelines in late September — a clandestine act for which no one has taken responsibility — Gazprom said it was closing Nord Stream indefinitely. Gas prices in Europe, which were already multiples higher than at the same time one year prior, soared further as a result. 
Moscow previously accused the British navy of blowing up the infrastructure in September, which London has rejected. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg labeled damage to the pipelines as sabotage.

The United Nations high commissioner for human rights warned of dramatically worse conditions to come in Ukraine if Russia continues attacking the country's infrastructure.
""Additional strikes could lead to a further serious deterioration in the humanitarian situation and spark more displacement,"" Volker Turk, the high commissioner, said to the organization's human rights council after a visit to Ukraine. Russia's attacks on key energy facilities and other vital civilian infrastructure were putting millions of people through ""extreme hardship,"" he said.
Huge swathes of Ukraine are facing regular and often prolonged blackouts as authorities race to repair them after each attack. Geopolitical analysts say the aim of the Russian strikes is to make large parts of the country unlivable as the cold winter sets in, threatening starvation and death. 
Rights groups say that deliberately targeting civilian infrastructure is a war crime. The Kremlin has argued that its strikes are in response to Ukrainian attacks on Russian facilities like its Crimean bridge, which was damaged in an explosion on Oct. 8. Russia has been attacking Ukraine since Feb. 24.

The deputy chief of Ukraine's General Staff of the Armed Forces has ruled out the possibility of a ceasefire while Russian invaders remain on Ukrainian soil. 
Moscow on Dec. 14 similarly said that a potential suspension of hostilities for Christmas was not on the cards, after 10 months of war in Ukraine.
""I believe that there will be a complete ceasefire from our side only when not a single occupier remains on our land,"" Ukrainian state news agency Ukrinform quoted Brigadier General Oleksiy Gromov as saying today, according to a Google translation. His comment came in response to a question over a prospective suspension of hostilities for New Year celebrations.

Russian shelling in Ukraine's south-eastern city of Kherson killed two people, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, the deputy head of the president's office, wrote on Telegram.
The individuals were killed in the city's center, about 100 meters away from the regional administration building, Tymoshenko said. Kherson was recaptured by Ukrainian forces and liberated from its Russian occupiers in early November, but since then has faced near-constant shelling by Russia forces, many of whom remain on the other side of the Dnipro River.
Russian President Vladimir Putin in late September declared Kherson and three other Ukrainian regions as annexed by Russia, a move that is illegal under international law, and has vowed to keep them as Russian territory.
— Natasha Turak
EU member states failed to reach consensus on a new sanctions package for Russia, which would be the bloc's ninth since Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in late February.
Progress on the sanctions stalled due to disagreement over whether the EU should ease the process of Russian fertilizers being transported through European ports. Poland and the Baltic states objected, saying a relaxation of restrictions could be used by Russian oligarchs who own fertilizer businesses to evade sanctions, according to EU officials cited by Reuters.
Those in favor of the easing say that the current restrictions threaten food security, particularly in developing nations. Russia is the world's top exporter of fertilizer. Some states want the UN's World Food Programme to become involved in authorizing fertilizer exports to parts of the world that rely on them.

Russia has warned the U.S. that if it sends Patriot missile systems to Ukraine it will consider the move a provocation that could lead to ""unpredictable consequences.""
The Biden administration is finalizing plans to send a Patriot missile system to Ukraine, three Defense officials told NBC News earlier this week. The surface-to-air defense system would help Ukraine repel Russian aerial attacks and President Zelenskyy has long called for such weaponry to help Ukraine defend itself against repeated missile attacks.
The Russian embassy in Washington warned in a statement on Telegram Wednesday that sending the Patriot missile system would be considered ""provocative.""""An information campaign has been launched in the United States on a possible future shipment of modern air defense systems to Kiev. It is said that President Biden may soon take such a decision."" the statement from the Russian embassy noted.""If this is confirmed, we will witness yet another provocative step by the administration, which can lead to unpredictable consequences.""
The embassy claimed that, even without delivery of the Patriot systems, ""the United States is increasingly drawn into the conflict in the post-Soviet republic, saying that the ""weapons flow"" to Ukraine was increasing and that the U.S. was helping Ukraine in terms of intelligence and military training.
The Kremlin said Wednesday that it would consider Patriot missile defense systems as a legitimate target for Russian strikes if they are sent to Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian forces are destroying ""everything in front of them.""
""There is no calm on the front line. There is nothing easy and simple. Every day and every meter is fought for extremely hard,"" Zelenskyy said in a nightly address on his Telegram channel.
""Russia is destroying city after city in Donbas - like Mariupol, like Volnovakha, like Bakhmut,"" he added..
Zelenskyy also thanked Ukrainian forces for ""repelling another attack by Iranian drones this morning.""
— Amanda Macias
Moscow said no ""Christmas ceasefire"" was on the cards after nearly 10 months of war in Ukraine, where the first major drone attack on the capital Kyiv in weeks damaged two buildings but was largely repelled by air defenses.
The two sides are not currently engaged in talks to end the conflict, which has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions more and turned cities to rubble since Russia invaded its neighbour on Feb. 24.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this week Russia should start withdrawing from his country by Christmas as a step to end Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two. Moscow rejected the proposal outright, saying Ukraine must accept the loss of territory to Russia before any progress can be made.

The U.N. warned that nearly 7 million children in Ukraine are don't have regular access to electricity, heat or water, raising their risks as temperatures drop. 
""Millions of children are facing a bleak winter huddled in the cold and the dark, with little idea of how or when respite may arrive,"" UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell said in a statement.
In addition to the freezing temperatures, the lack of adequate electricity interrupts their education with schools damaged or destroyed and so many children relying on remote learning, UNICEF said. 
""Beyond the immediate threats the freezing conditions bring, children are also deprived of the ability to learn or stay connected with friends and family, putting both their physical and their mental health at desperate risk,"" she added.
In October, Russian forces intensified attacks on energy infrastructure and were successful in destroying nearly half of Ukraine's power production.

88669,83967,"When Vladimir Putin sent up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine on 24 February 2022, he wrongly assumed he could sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in a matter of days and depose the government.
After a series of humiliating retreats, his initial invasion plan has clearly failed, but Russia's war is far from over.
Even now, Russia's leader describes the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two as a ""special military operation"". Not the full-scale war that has bombed civilians across Ukraine and left more than 13 million either as refugees abroad or displaced inside their own country. 
His declared goal on 24 February 2022 was to ""demilitarise and denazify"" Ukraine and not occupy it by force, days after backing independence for eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014. 
He vowed to protect people from eight years of Ukrainian bullying and genocide - a Russian propaganda claim with no foundation in reality. He spoke of preventing Nato from gaining a foothold in Ukraine, then added another objective of ensuring Ukraine's neutral status.
President Putin never said it out loud, but high on the agenda was toppling the government of Ukraine's elected president. ""The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two,"" said Volodymyr Zelensky. Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound, according to his adviser. 
Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide never added up, but Russian state-run news agency Ria Novosti explained that ""denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation"" - in effect, erasing the modern state of Ukraine.
For years, the Russian president has denied Ukraine its own statehood, writing in a lengthy 2021 essay that ""Russians and Ukrainians were one people"" dating back to the late 9th Century.
A month into the invasion and his campaign goals were dramatically scaled back after a retreat from Kyiv and Chernihiv. The main goal became the ""liberation of Donbas"" - broadly referring to Ukraine's two industrial regions in the east of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Forced into further retreats from Kharkiv in the north-east and Kherson in the south, that aim remains unchanged, but it has shown little success in achieving it.
Those reverses on the battlefield rushed Russia's leader into annexing four Ukrainian provinces last September, without having full control of any of them: neither Luhansk or Donetsk in the east, nor Kherson or Zaporizhzhia to the south. 
To bolster his depleted forces President Putin announced Russia's first mobilisation since World War Two, although it was partial and limited to some 300,000 reservists. 
A war of attrition is now taking place along an active front line of 850km (530 miles) and Russian victories are small and rare. What was meant to be a quick operation is now a protracted war that Western leaders are determined Ukraine should win. Any realistic prospect of neutrality for Ukraine is long gone.
President Putin warned in December that the war ""could be a lengthy process"", but then added later that Russia's goal was ""not to spin the flywheel of military conflict"", but to end it. There is little hope of that on the horizon.
A year into the war, he talks of Russia fighting to defend its ""historical frontiers"" and ""rebuilding peaceful life in Donbas and Novorossiya"", spelling out that Ukraine's southern territories are part of his project, just as much as the east.
The biggest success President Putin can lay claim to is establishing a land bridge from Russia's border to Crimea, annexed illegally in 2014, so it is no longer reliant on its bridge over the Kerch Strait. 
He has spoken of the capture of this territory, which includes the cities of Mariupol and Melitopol, as a ""significant result for Russia"". The Sea of Azov, inside the Kerch Strait, ""has become Russia's internal sea"", he declared, pointing out that even Russian Tsar Peter the Great did not manage that. 
Beyond seizing a territorial corridor to Crimea, Russia's bloody, unprovoked war has been a disaster for itself and the country it was unleashed on. So far, it has achieved little more than exposing the brutality and inadequacy of the Russian military.
While cities such as Mariupol were flattened, details of war crimes have emerged against civilians in Bucha, near Kyiv, and have led to an independent report that accused Russia itself of state-orchestrated incitement to genocide.
But it is the military failures that have shown Russia at its weakest:
Russia's warnings to the West against arming Ukraine have gone unheeded, with Western assurances of support ""for as long as it takes"" and pledges that Nato will never be divided. 
Superior US Himars missiles helped turn the course of the war and German Leopard 2 tanks are promised, even if Western fighter jets are not. A succession of Western leaders, including President Joe Biden, have made the complex journey to Kyiv.
But this war is not over. The fight for Donbas continues. Russia has captured the town of Soledar this year and has hopes of seizing the eastern city of Bakhmut on the road to key cities to the west, and of recapturing territory it lost last autumn.
Putin watchers believe he will seek to extend control of the four regions that he has declared to be part of Russia, not just in Donbas, but towards the key city of Zaporizhzhia.
Should he need to, President Putin could extend mobilisation and drag out the war. Russia is a nuclear power and he has indicated he would be prepared, if necessary, to use nuclear weapons to protect Russia and cling on to occupied Ukrainian land. ""We will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff,"" he warned.
Kyiv believes Russia is also seeking to depose the pro-European government in Moldova, where Russian troops are based in the breakaway region of Transnistria bordering Ukraine.
Neither Russia nor Ukraine give details of their own losses, so reliable numbers are extremely difficult. But Russians losses have been especially heavy in recent weeks, with several hundred deaths every day on the battlefields of the east.
BBC Russian has identified more than 15,000 Russian soldiers killed in the first year of war and suggests the most conservative estimate would be at least double that, with more than 100,000 others wounded or missing.
UK defence intelligence believes Russian casualties increased significantly after partial mobilisation, reaching 175-200,000 in total, of whom 40-60,000 were killed.
Ukraine revealed at the end of 2022 that 10-13,000 of its soldiers had been killed since the start of the war. That figure cannot be confirmed, but it followed a US estimate of some 100,000 Ukrainians killed or wounded by November. Before Western artillery arrived in the east last summer, Kyiv officials said 100 to 200 troops were dying every day.
The UN human rights commissioner says at least 8,006 civilians have died and 13,287 have been wounded in 12 months of war, but the true number is likely to be substantially higher.
President Putin, 70, has sought to distance himself from military failures, but his authority, at least outside Russia, has been shredded and he makes few trips beyond its borders.
At home, Russia's economy on the surface appears to have weathered a series of Western sanctions for now, although its budget deficit has soared and oil and gas revenue has fallen dramatically.
Any attempt to gauge his popularity is fraught with difficulty.
Dissent in Russia is highly risky, with jail sentences handed out for anyone spreading ""fake news"" about the Russian military. Those opposing Russia's leadership have either fled or, as with main opposition figure Alexei Navalny, been thrown into prison.
The seeds of this war were sown in 2013, when Moscow persuaded Ukraine's pro-Russian leader to scrap a planned pact with the European Union, prompting protests that ultimately brought him down and led to Russia seizing Crimea and staging a land-grab in the east.
Four months into Russia's 2022 invasion, the EU granted Ukraine candidate status and Kyiv is pushing to be accepted as soon as it can.
Russia's long-time leader was also desperate to prevent Ukraine from entering Nato's orbit, but his attempt to blame the Western defensive alliance for the war is false.
Not only did Ukraine reportedly agree before the war a provisional deal with Russia to stay out of Nato but, in March, President Zelensky offered to maintain Ukraine as a non-aligned, non-nuclear state:  ""It's a truth and it must be recognised.""
No end is currently in sight. 
Ukraine's position is that Russian troops must pull back beyond Ukraine's internationally recognised borders for there to be peace. It is backed by two UN resolutions, passed days after the invasion and hours before the first anniversary of the war.
By annexing four regions Russia does not even fully control, Vladimir Putin has made it very hard for himself to give them up.
There is little prospect for now of a ceasefire or peace talks. Turkey had some success last summer with the UN in mediating a deal on resuming grain exports through the Black Sea but has had no success since. China is looking for a role in securing a political settlement, but its position is probably too close to Russia to be considered an honest broker.
Nato member states have increasingly sent Ukraine air defence systems to protect its cities, as well as missile systems, artillery and drones that helped turn the tide against Russia's invasion.
But it is not to blame for the war and has no troops on the ground. Nato's expansion comes as a response to the Russian threat - Sweden and Finland only applied to join because of the invasion. 
Blaming Nato's expansion eastwards is a Russian narrative that has gained some ground in Europe. Before the war, President Putin demanded Nato turn the clock back to 1997 and remove its forces and military infrastructure from Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics.
In his eyes, the West promised back in 1990 that Nato would expand ""not an inch to the east"", yet did so anyway. That was before the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, so the promise made to then Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev referred merely to East Germany in the context of a reunified Germany.
Mr Gorbachev said later that ""the topic of Nato expansion was never discussed"" at the time.
Nato maintains it never intended to deploy combat troops on its eastern flank, until Russia annexed Crimea illegally in 2014.

Islamist militant group Hamas on Sunday accused the United States of taking part in ""aggression against Palestinian people"" by sending a Navy carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean Sea.
The Navy carrier strike group includes the USS Gerald R. Ford, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, accompanied by guided missile destroyers and guided missile cruisers. 
The US is also positioning more fighter jets to the Middle East, as a deterrent to Hezbollah in Lebanon and other militant groups aligned against Israel, officials say.

At least 10 Nepali citizens were killed when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on Saturday, Nepal's ambassador to Israel told CNN on Sunday.
The deceased were agriculture students in the Alumim kibbutz, Ambassador Kanta Rizal said.
One Nepali student remains missing, Rizal added. 
Officials say the death toll in Israel has passed 700 following Hamas' unprecedented surprise attack that began on Saturday. More than 400 Palestinians have died in the Israeli military response, according to the health ministry in Gaza.

The Israeli embassy in Bogota has been vandalized with graffiti including swastikas, Israel's envoy to Colombia said on Sunday.
Photos posted by Ambassador Gali Dagan on X, formerly Twitter, show a pillar of the embassy building daubed with a swastika next to the Star of David and pro-Palestinian slogans. 
The incident comes after Colombian President Gustavo Petro expressed support for the recognition of Palestine on Saturday, slamming the international community for treating the ""Israeli occupation in Palestine"" in a ""very different way"" from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 
CNN has reached out to Bogota police for more details about the incident.

A professor emeritus from Brandies University in Massachusetts said his daughter and son-in-law were killed in the Hamas attacks on Israel on Saturday. 
Ilan Troen told NPR that his daughter and son-in-law tried to shield their son from gunfire as militants attacked. 
It is unclear whether Troen’s daughter and son-in-law, whose names have not been released, were US citizens.

Israel has ""severely degraded the capabilities"" of Palestinian militant group Hamas as airstrikes on Gaza continued into early Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said.
The IDF said it targeted a structure that housed Hamas operatives and several of the group's operational command centers, including a three-floor command center.
The IDF also said it targeted:

US lawmakers and Biden administration officials discussed increasing support for Israel at a briefing with House leadership on Sunday night, three people familiar with the call told CNN. 
Senior officials from the State and Defense Departments told the lawmakers they are moving as quickly as they can to deliver weapons and resources to Israel as part of already existing contracts, the sources said.
That could help ensure that Washington provides some items as soon as possible, amid questions about how quickly Congress could act on a larger aid package.

The death toll is rising in Israel and Gaza as fighting rages between Israeli forces and Hamas militants and as more details emerge of the dead and those taken hostage.
Israel formally declared war on Hamas on Sunday after the Islamist militant group launched its deadly surprise assault on Saturday. Israel also cut power to Gaza — complicating medical care efforts as the densely-populated territory is pounded by Israeli airstrikes.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke on the phone with his Saudi counterpart, Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud, with both expressing concern over the situation in Israel and Gaza, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. 
He urged humanitarian aid and said Saudi Arabia is willing to work with China to ""promote all parties to abide by international humanitarian law, protect civilians from harm, and implement relevant Security Council resolutions on the Palestinian issue.""
China's Wang Yi said that Israel's actions have ""gone beyond the scope of self-defense,"" the statement said. 
Saudi Arabia has been in talks to normalize relations with Israel in recent months, something Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in September described as a pact that would be “the biggest historical deal since the Cold War.”

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has told CNN it is reviewing the circumstances surrounding an incident in which a journalist died on the Lebanese border. 
It comes after the Lebanese Army accused Israel of ""firing a projectile that hit a civilian car belonging to a media team,"" leading to the death of Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah on Friday. 
The IDF statement said that on Friday afternoon, Hezbollah militants had launched attacks at several positions along the Blue Line, firing an anti-tank missile that struck the security fence of Israel near the community of Hanita.

US Air Forces Central on Saturday announced the deployment of F-15E fighter jets and A-10 ground-attack jets to the Middle East region.
The movement of the warplanes from the 494th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron and 354th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron, respectively, “bolster the US posture and enhance air operations throughout the Middle East,” an Air Force statement said. It did not specify the number of warplanes involved.
A US Central Command social media post said the A-10s will join another squadron of the aircraft already in the region.
Israel will start ""significant military operations"" in Gaza once they see that civilians have left, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson told CNN. 
""It's really important that people in Gaza know we've been very, very generous with the time. We have given ample warning, more than 25 hours... I cannot stress more than enough to say now is the time for Gazans to leave. 
More than half of Gaza’s 2 million residents live in the northern section that Israel has told to evacuate. Many families, some of whom were already internally displaced, are now crammed into an even smaller portion of the 140-square-mile territory.
Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been fleeing south through the battered streets of Gaza after the Israeli military told them to leave northern areas of the densely populated strip.
Parts of the south are becoming even more crowded and overstretched, Gazans say, as waves of Palestinians abandon their homes in the wake of Israel’s statement, ahead of an anticipated ground assault by the IDF.
According to Conricus, the area around the Gaza Strip is densely packed with ""hundreds of thousands of Israeli reserve units"" that are preparing for various missions.

Gaza residents spoke to CNN Saturday following Israel’s military announcement it is preparing for the ""next stages of the war"" against Hamas.
Hind al-Khoudari, 28, a Philippine national from Gaza, told CNN she was stranded at the Rafah crossing to Egypt with her family all day and had to pull back to central Gaza because the crossing is closed.
Khoudari said she arrived at the crossing Saturday morning with her husband and his family in order to leave the Gaza Strip. They encountered more than 20 families with passports from various countries.
After waiting for hours, they were told they will not be able to leave Gaza today, because the Egyptian authorities want the crossing to serve “a humanitarian cause and not only evacuation for foreigners.” Egyptians told her in-laws to stay close to the area of Rafah crossing and be ready for a phone call to leave at any minute.

Abdul Rahman Abu Ghali, a displaced man from north of Gaza City, came to the city of Deir al Balah in central Gaza following recent developments in the region. He shared his views with CNN on the recent Israeli military actions.
Abu Ghali said children in his area “can’t find food to eat and water to drink.”
“These are very bad days. I think they will be getting worse and worse and worse. These people have no mercy,” he added.
Remember: The Israeli offensive was launched in response to devastating terror attacks by Hamas last week. Hamas runs Gaza, which has spiraled into a humanitarian crisis due to Israel's airstrikes and siege, which has cut off access to basic resources.
Hamas has carried out attacks on Israel for years, and Israel has controlled a blockade on Gaza since the militant group took control of the territory in 2007.

Motaz al-Azayza, 24, a media activist and medic volunteer, told CNN he went back home to Gaza to see his family and then started volunteering with Bahrain Red Crescent Society.
While he was working as a medic volunteer and a cameraman, his organization received a call about a bombing in the city of Deir al-Balah. The bombing, according to him, ended up “in a new massacre.”
“There were 20 murdered and more than maybe 30 injured,” he said.
Azaya recounted sitting in the front seat of an ambulance when a child's body was brought to him and put on his lap.
“I hope someone like an official person from anywhere in the world will start to take action to stop this madness. What is happening to Gazans is it's a disaster. It's a real disaster. It’s like the last day of the Earth.”

""Hate toward one group left unanswered opens the door for more hate, toward more groups, more often, readily,"" Biden said, adding that ""the antidote to hate is love"" and ""silence is complicity.""

The situation following a deadly blast at a hospital in Gaza is ""unparalleled and indescribable,"" said Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Ministry of Health. 
Al-Qudra said in a statement on Wednesday (local time) that the blast killed hundreds of people ""and ambulance crews are still removing body parts as most of the victims are children and women.""
He noted that the number of victims and their injuries ""exceeded the capabilities of medical teams and ambulances.""
Al-Qudra added: ""Doctors were performing surgeries on the ground and in the corridors, some of them without anesthesia and a large number of injured people are still waiting for operations, and the medical teams are trying to save their lives in intensive care.""
More context: Hundreds of people are believed to be dead following a strike on a hospital in Gaza. Palestinian officials blamed ongoing Israeli airstrikes for the lethal incident, while a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces said a Palestinian Islamic Jihad group is responsible for a “failed rocket launch” that hit the hospital.
From CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq
Ambassador Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian Observer to the United Nations, accused Israel of carrying out the deadly blast at the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza on Tuesday.
He said Israeli officials were being dishonest in blaming Palestinian Islamic Jihad for the blast. 
The Israel Defense Forces said earlier on Tuesday that their intelligence shows a “failed rocket launch” by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group was responsible for the explosion that left hundreds dead.

The Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem condemned the deadly explosion that took place at the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza Tuesday, according to a statement. 
The diocese oversees the board and administration for the hospital and exclusively funds the facility through the Anglican Church via international donations.
The diocese said they were observing a global day of fasting and prayers to end the conflict that “was marred by a brutal attack"" on the hospital, the statement read. 
The diocese announced a day of mourning in all of its churches and institutions. 
“Gaza remains bereft of safe havens,” the diocese said, and called the blast a crime against humanity in their statement. 
The diocese also said “the devastation witnessed, coupled with the sacrilegious targeting of the church, strikes at the very core of human decency,"" adding that “we assert unequivocally that this is deserving international condemnation and retribution.”

The US State Department issued a travel advisory Tuesday warning Americans not to travel to Lebanon.
The department will allow family members and some non-emergency US government personnel from the embassy in Beirut to voluntarily depart the country “due to the unpredictable security situation.”
The travel advisory level for Lebanon was raised to Level 4: Do Not Travel on Tuesday “due to the unpredictable security situation related to rocket, missile, and artillery exchanges between Israel and Hizballah or other armed militant factions,” according to an updated advisory.
The advisory made note of the fact that “large demonstrations have erupted in the wake of recent violence in Israel and Gaza.”
The advisory warned that “U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Lebanon should be aware that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to travel to assist them.”
“The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut sufficiently serious to require them to live and work under strict security. The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice,” the advisory read.
Last week, the State Department raised the travel advisory for Israel to Level 3: Reconsider Travel. The advisory for Gaza remains at the most severe – Level 4: Do Not Travel.

Israel feels “very strongly” they did not cause the explosion at a hospital in Gaza, the White House said Tuesday. 
He said US President Joe Biden spoke with “all the leaders involved” about his trip to the region Tuesday afternoon “so that all of them could make a collective decision about the value of continuing.”
Asked if the US was giving Israel the “benefit of the doubt,” Kirby declined to weigh in on where the administration thinks responsibility lies for the blast. 
Biden has directed the national security team to gather as much information and context as possible “so that we can learn more about what happened,” Kirby said.
As for the cancellation of Biden’s trip to Amman, Jordan, Kirby said it was a “mutual decision” between Jordanian and US officials. 
Biden was set to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and others in Jordan, but Abbas canceled his meeting with Biden earlier Tuesday. 
The White House said that was due to a three-day mourning period.
Asked why the president didn’t push his trip back until after the three-day mourning period, Kirby said there was still a “pretty robust agenda” for Biden on the ground in Israel.
“He wants to have these discussions directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the war cabinet,” Kirby said. “He's looking forward to having an opportunity to thank the first responders, he obviously feels it's important, as is his normal desire, to talk to family members who are suffering and anxious and worried and grieving.”
“Even though the Amman portion isn't going to happen — again for perfectly understandable reasons — that doesn't negate the reason for going,” Kirby said.

They added that “U.S. government-facilitated flights are scheduled to continue on a rolling basis from Ben Gurion International Airport through at least Sunday, October 22.”
“The departure options we have offered have generally departed at half capacity or less,” they said.
They said “thousands of U.S. citizens have reached out via our online form or via phone since October 7,” but “many have not sought to depart.”
“We are not in a position to share detailed breakdowns of the number of U.S. citizens seeking departure assistance, or the number of U.S. citizens whose departure we have facilitated, given this is an unfolding situation,” they added.

France said it ""strongly condemns the strike against the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza City, which caused a very high number of Palestinian civilian casualties,"" according to statement from the country's Foreign Ministry.
Pakistan called the deadly blast an “Israeli attack” and the Israeli military was “inhumane and indefensible” for “attacking a hospital, where civilians were seeking shelter and emergency treatment,"" according to a statement from the country’s Ministry of Foreign  Affairs.

When President Joe Biden touches down in Israel for a high-security wartime visit, his focus will be on managing a complicated situation and less on securing clear deliverables, according to two sources close to the matter. It's a clear signal of the White House seeking to manage expectations after a major portion of the trip was scrapped at the last-minute. 
The presence of Biden, who places a premium on personal diplomacy, is meant to show solidarity with the United States’s closest allies and to deter rogue actors in the region from opening up a second front in the war. 
But the sudden cancelation Tuesday night of a major summit with Arab leaders in Jordan posed additional challenges for the president, who had hoped to return to the US after having firmly established a way for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza. 
The visit to Israel carries significant risks – both physical and political – with active conflict and asymmetric information.  
A blast at a Gaza hospital Tuesday that Palestinian officials say left hundreds dead led to a last-minute briefing by the president's top national security advisers and a phone call with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is still traveling in the Middle East, to assess the intelligence available. 
But no conclusion was drawn about who was behind the attack, CNN has learned, with the president instructing his team to continue evaluating the available information. 
The blast – which led to the cancellation of a summit between Biden and Arab leaders in Jordan – was always seen as a possible, and to some extent even probable, risk of such a visit, and the president’s team concluded that the merits of the trip outweighed those risks. 
Even as conflicting claims were coming in about who was responsible for the devastating hospital blast in Gaza and the second half of Biden’s trip was scrapped altogether, multiple sources told CNN that the president’s top advisers did not come close on Tuesday to canceling the Israel portion of the trip. 
The president will be meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu and his War Cabinet to glean information about what security assistance the US can provide, and he will be assessing the humanitarian situation – with discussions continuing about sending aid into Gaza and allowing refugees to cross through the Rafah crossing into Egypt. 
Despite ongoing discussions with Israel and other partners, sources downplayed the expectation that the visit would result immediately in a refugee deal or the release of American hostages in Hamas custody.

The US, Egypt and Israel have all signaled readiness for aid to begin moving into Gaza, following a high-profile visit to Israel by US President Joe Biden.

President Joe Biden plans to argue the US should continue funding wars in both Ukraine and Israel during an Oval Office address Thursday, according to two administration officials.
The primetime address will take place the eve of the White House requesting north of $100 billion from Congress to deliver aid and resources to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the US border with Mexico. Biden is expected to make the argument that supporting Ukraine and Israel is a matter of US national security at a time when the world is at an inflection point.
Public opinion has been mixed on the conflicts. In a recent CNN poll, nearly all respondents were sympathetic with the Israeli people in the wake of surprise attacks launched by Hamas, but there was no clear consensus on the right level of US involvement. One-third (35%) said the US is providing the right amount of assistance – and another 36% were unsure whether the level of US assistance is appropriate. The US has long provided security assistance with Israel, which receives roughly $4 billion annually under a 10-year memorandum of understanding. The new request would provide billions more.
By contrast, support to sustain aid to Ukraine has waned significantly. An August CNN poll found 55% of respondents said Congress should not pass more funding to aid Ukraine. The partisan divide has been deepening, too: Nearly three-quarters of Republicans opposed more funding for Ukraine, while 62% of Democrats supported it.
Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the White House and Congress have provided more than $75 billion in funding to Kyiv, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
The Biden administration in August delivered its last so-called supplemental funding request, which encapsulates unique requests beyond traditional government programs. The proposal requested $24.1 billion to aid Ukraine through the end of the year, but Congress failed to approve it during a process to greenlight short-term federal funding.
Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pledged to European leaders that the US would be able to secure support for additional aid and, in an interview with Sky News, said Washington could afford financing two wars at once.

When Hamas militants broke through the Gaza fence in this month’s unprecedented attack on Israel, the kibbutz of Mefalsim — less than 2 miles from the border — was on the front lines. Toting AK-47 rifles and grenade launchers, one group of militants headed straight for the community’s gates, while another group moved to destroy its generator, according to security videos and local residents.
That precision, local Israeli security personnel say, was no accident: The fighters seemed to have known exactly where they were headed.
CNN has reviewed documents that Israeli officials say were Hamas attack plans, which suggest that the group collected remarkably granular detail on its targets. But neither of the attacks went according to plan – thanks in part to a handful of volunteer guards who defended their neighbors in dramatic firefights.
Photos of the plan to attack Mefalsim were posted online by an Israeli first responder group, which said it was recovered from the body of a slain Hamas fighter. Two local Israeli security personnel told CNN they independently saw photos of the plan, and it closely matched the Hamas fighters’ tactics during the attack.
The color-coded document includes detailed information about the kibbutz’s guards and security. It says that one group of militants would break through the community’s fence, while others were ordered to “capture soldiers and civilians and to keep hostages” for negotiation.
Yarden Reskin, a member of Mefalsim’s volunteer security force who spent hours exchanging fire with militants – helping prevent any deaths inside the community – said he was shocked by the level of detail.
Another purported Hamas document laying out plans to attack the nearby kibbutz of Sa’ad, which CNN obtained from a senior Israeli government official, was even more chilling. It listed the attackers’ goal as “inflicting the maximum possible human casualties.”
Like in Mefalsim, the plans didn’t come to fruition, with a first responder group and a local resident telling CNN that no residents had died inside Sa’ad.
The difference between the detailed plans and what occurred on the ground is a sign of the chaos that spread during the attack, as Hamas fighters encountered far less resistance from the Israeli military than they expected. Despite the billions of dollars Israel has spent securing its border and developing one of the world’s most renowned intelligence operations, its armed forces were caught off guard.

As anger rises across the Middle East, Secretary of State Antony Blinken sent a State Department cable to all US embassies and consulates across the world Wednesday.
He ordered diplomatic security officers to convene each embassies' security committee to conduct emergency reviews of its' security to determine if it needs to be ramped up. 
Blinken’s cable — obtained by CNN — ordered the State Department’s Regional Security Officers (RSOs) to consider whether messages to Americans in those countries need advising of potential areas to avoid or precautions to take. All embassies were directed to report back to the State Department in Washington on whatever steps were being taken.
CNN has reached out to the State Department for comment.
CNN reported earlier Wednesday about steps taken at numerous consulates and embassies in the region, including that the US consulate in Adana, Turkey, “will remain closed to the public until further notice” amid ongoing protests, and that the US embassy in Beirut advised Americans to avoid the Awkar area also due to protests. 
In the past week, the State Department has raised the travel advisory to the highest level for Israel and Lebanon to warn Americans against going there, and has authorized the departure of some non-emergency US government personnel and family members from those countries.
Meanwhile, law enforcement remains on very high alert across the US. 
The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security, along with the National Counterterrorism Center issued a Joint Intelligence Bulletin Wednesday sharing information and a threat assessment advising state and local law enforcement agencies. The bulletin,  sent Wednesday and obtained by CNN, specifies that ""lone offenders inspired by, or reacting to, the ongoing Israel-HAMAS conflict pose the most likely threat to Americans."" 
The bulletin also notes that “the FBI has seen an increase in reports of threats against faith communities, particularly Jewish and Muslim communities.” 
The joint bulletin goes on to say that while Hamas has not specifically called for attacks on US soil, it notes that other foreign terrorist organizations have called for attacks in the US and that “may prompt homegrown extremists” to target attacks in the United States at Israeli, Jewish or US Government targets.

Video from an Al Jazeera news camera appears to show a rocket fired from a Gaza explosion in flight above Gaza City, which happened moments before an explosion is seen at Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital. 
It is still not clear if they are related. 
CNN is continuing to conduct its own investigation into the blast at the hospital, and has not yet made any final conclusions.
CNN began reviewing this video Tuesday shortly after the explosion. Since then, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has pointed to this video as evidence that it was not responsible for the explosion at the hospital. 
CNN referenced nearby buildings in the video to geolocate them to an area just west of the hospital. 
The video was broadcast live from an east-facing Al Jazeera camera and captures the rocket trail rising into the air just a few seconds after it was launched. The time on the screen reads 6:59 p.m local time.
By geolocating where the Al Jazeera video was taken from, and the direction it's capturing, CNN has determined the rocket was fired from an area south of Gaza City. The rocket can be seen in the video continuing to rise, until it suddenly veers straight up in the air.
The rocket then is seen making a sharp turn back toward the direction from where it was fired. A streak of fire is seen as the rocket flies significantly faster, continuing back toward the direction it was fired.  
Suddenly, the rocket is seen exploding mid-flight, in the air high above Gaza City. The rocket trail is no longer visible. From the video, it is unclear where the rocket ultimately fell.
Retired Col. Cedric Leighton told CNN after reviewing the video that ""it's consistent with a malfunctioning rocket."" 
Moments after the mid-air explosion, a flash of light is seen in the video in the east toward the ground. As the camera pans down, an explosion in another area of east Gaza City is seen. 
Then, a second flash of light — an explosion — is seen at the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital complex.
There is only one rocket trail seen in the video. If the rising rocket was intercepted by another rocket, there would be another rocket trail. 
The Iron Dome system is programmed to only intercept rockets that are about to land in Israel. The location of this explosion is in the middle of Gaza and an intercept that far into Gaza would be unusual, according to CNN’s Jerusalem correspondent Hadas Gold.

Vice President Kamala Harris said in an interview that the US has “absolutely no intention” of sending American combat troops into Israel or Gaza amid fears over a wider regional conflict.
Harris, who has been included in briefings and phone calls on the Middle East crisis, closely stuck to the administration’s approach: Supporting Israel’s right to defend itself while also calling for the protection of civilians.

The number of children reported killed in Gaza during Israel’s military campaign over the past three weeks has surpassed the annual number of children killed in armed conflict globally in each of the past four years, according to Save the Children.
More than 3,000 children have been reported killed in Gaza since October 7 by the enclave's Hamas-controlled health authorities. 
A total of 2,985 children were killed across 24 countries in 2022, 2,515 were killed in 2021 and 2,674 in 2020, according to the United Nations secretary general's annual report on children and armed conflict, cited by Save the Children.
In 2019, the UN reported 4,019 children were killed in conflicts around the world. 
Save the Children has added its voice to those calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.

Close US ally Jordan has asked Washington to deploy Patriot missiles to strengthen its air defenses at its borders, a Jordanian military spokesperson told state media on Sunday. 
The request comes at a time of heightening tensions in the Middle East due to the war in Gaza as well as clashes on the Lebanon-Israel border between Hezbollah and Israeli forces. 
Al-Hiyari said Jordan is facing ongoing threats, including ballistic missiles, from the north, east and west and the Patriot air defense system is “the best weapon to confront such a threat.”
Jordan is also requesting a system to combat drones that are used on drug smuggling, as they “have become a threat to all our fronts,” Al-Hiyari added.
CNN has reached out to US officials for comment.

Israeli forces struck military infrastructure in Syrian territory following launches toward Israel from the country, Israel's military said Monday. 
Israeli warplanes regularly bomb targets in Syria, where the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights separates Israel from Iran-aligned fighters.
Iran's president said Sunday that Israel's offensive in Gaza had ""crossed the red lines,"" as the US national security adviser warned of an ""elevated risk"" of the war expanding into a broader Middle East conflict.

The UN warns ""civil order"" is deteriorating in Gaza after weeks of siege and bombardment, with people breaking into warehouses to take survival essentials. 
Here are today's top headlines:
More on the warehouse break-ins: The United Nations World Food Programme said some of its aid supplies were looted in Gaza and warned of ""growing hunger and desperation"" in a news release Sunday. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East said earlier Sunday that ""thousands"" of people had broken into some of its warehouses and distribution centers in the central and southern areas of the strip, ""taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies.""
The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting Monday: The United Arab Emirates, the only Arab country with a seat in the UN Security Council at the moment, will seek a binding resolution from other Security Council members for an ""immediate humanitarian pause"" in the fighting, sources said. Earlier this month, the United States vetoed a draft resolution at the UNSC which called for a humanitarian pause. 
Gaza's second-largest hospital suffers extensive damage: Israeli airstrikes have “caused extensive damage to hospital departments and exposed residents and patients to suffocation” at the Al-Quds Hospital, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Sunday, accusing Israel of “deliberately” launching the airstrikes next to Gaza City's second-largest hospital ""with the aim of forcing the medical staff, displaced people, and patients to evacuate the hospital.” The organization said it has received a warning Sunday from Israel to immediately evacuate the hospital ahead of possible bombardment, which the World Health Organization has said would be ""impossible"" without endangering patients' lives.
Israel appears to have advanced over two miles into Gaza: The troops in the video, taken on Saturday, are seen putting an Israeli flag on a Gaza resort hotel's roof. CNN geolocated the video to an area just over two miles from the Gaza-Israeli border. The video is one of the first glimpses into where Israeli ground forces have been, and what they've been doing, during the expanded ground operations in Gaza. A communications blackout in Gaza has significantly hampered the flow of information out of it, though providers said service was gradually being restored Sunday.
Iran says Israel has ""crossed the red lines"" in Gaza: Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi said Sunday Israel's actions ""may force everyone to take action."" There are concerns that Israel's fierce military campaign in Gaza will open up more fronts. There is already crossfire exchanges on northern Israel and southern Lebanon border — separate from Israel's fighting with Hamas farther south, which is centered around Gaza. But an uptick in clashes with Hezbollah has raised fears that the powerful Lebanese paramilitary group could actively participate in the conflict. It comes as the US national security adviser warned of an ""elevated risk"" of the war expanding into a broader Middle East conflict.
Aid trucks cross from Egypt into Gaza: The Palestinian Red Crescent said it received 10 aid trucks via the Rafah border crossing, stating that the trucks contain ""food supplies and medical necessities. The total number of received trucks so far has reached 94, while fuel has not been allowed to enter yet. Meanwhile, Doctors Without Borders said it has sent 26 tons of medical supplies on a plane to Egypt to support the emergency medical response in Gaza.
Gaza death toll rises further: The death toll in Gaza has risen to 7,960, the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah announced on Sunday, drawing the data from sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave. More than 20,000 have been injured, the ministry said. Nearly three-quarters — 73% — of those killed are from vulnerable populations, including children, women, and elderly individuals, according to the ministry report, which adds that the total number of dead includes 116 medical personnel.
Video shows destruction at mosque and houses in a Gaza refugee camp: Video, obtained by CNN from a Gaza-based journalist, shows the aftermath of the destruction of a mosque and adjacent houses in the Al-Nuseirat refugee camp in central Gaza on Sunday. There is a large amount of destruction at the site of an airstrike, with people searching through the rubble to look for survivors.  
US pressured Israel to restore connectivity in Gaza: After phone and internet service was severed late last week, civilians, aid groups and journalists were left without any means of communicating with the outside world. Service appeared to be gradually restored on Sunday. ""We do feel strongly that the restoration of that communications was a critical thing,"" US national security adviser Jake Sullivan said. ""Because aid workers need to be able to communicate, civilians need to be able to communicate, and of course, journalists need to be able to document what is happening in Gaza to report it to the wider world.""

At least 10 people are injured after a crowd stormed an airport in southern Russia following the arrival of a flight from Tel Aviv, according to a statement by the Dagestan health ministry late Sunday.
The Makhachkala Uytash Airport in the Republic of Dagestan has temporarily closed and flights have been diverted after ""unknown persons"" broke into the airport Sunday, according to a statement released by the Russian Federal Air Transport Agency. 
Multiple videos posted on social media show a crowd of people inside the airport and on the airfield, some waving the Palestinian flag, others forcing their way through closed doors in the international terminal. The crowd entered the airport after a flight from Tel Aviv landed on Sunday, according to Russian state media TASS.
TASS reports that ""those gathered oppose the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.""
The injured are a mix of police officers and civilians, according to the health ministry, which said two people are in ""critical condition.""
The Red Wing Airlines flight from Tel Aviv arrived Sunday at 7:17 p.m. local time (12:17 p.m. ET), according to Flight Aware.
Officials react: The Israeli prime minister's office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a joint statement, saying Israel's government is monitoring developments at the airport. 
""Israel expects the Russian legal authorities to safeguard the well-being of all Israeli citizens and Jews wherever they are and to take strong action against the rioters and against the wild incitement being directed against Jews and Israelis,"" the statement added. 
The United States also called on Russia to protect Israelis and Jews.
In a post on the social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter, the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Antisemitism, Amb. Deborah E. Lipstadt, condemned the incident.
“We condemn the violent protests that have been reported in Russia threatening Israelis and Jews. We call on Russian authorities to ensure their safety,"" Lipstadt said.
Sergey Melikov, head of the Dagestan Republic, also denounced the unrest in a message on Telegram.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu received sharp criticism after he accused security chiefs in a now-deleted social media post of failing to warn him about the impending Hamas attack prior to October 7.
Amid a chorus of disapproval from opponents and allies, Netanyahu deleted the post on Sunday morning, issuing a rare apology and stating Israel’s security heads had his “full backing.”
But the incident has done little to quell increasing frustration and anger directed at Israel’s leader for failing to anticipate the brutal Hamas attacks, which saw the group kill at least 1,400 people and take more than 200 hostages, according to the Israel Defense Forces.
Netanyahu’s tweet comes at a time when he is also under increasing pressure from the families of hostages for a “comprehensive deal” to ensure their release. These calls are becoming more urgent amid concerns for what Israel’s expanding ground operations could mean for the safety of hostages trapped in Gaza.
In the now-deleted post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, Netanyahu said, “At no point was a warning given to Prime Minister Netanyahu on Hamas’s intention to start a war. On the contrary, all the defense officials, including the heads of the Intelligence Directorate and the Shin Bet, assessed that Hamas was deterred.”
An outpouring of criticism swiftly followed Netanyahu’s post, following which, the prime minister deleted the post on Sunday morning and issued an apology. “I was wrong. Things I said following the press conference should not have been said and I apologize for that,” he wrote on X. Israel’s security chiefs had his “full backing,” he added.
But even in this apology, Netanyahu made no mention of his own responsibility for the failure to anticipate the deadliest attack in Israel’s history. By contrast, security chiefs Ronen Bar and Maj. Gen. Aharon Haliva, as well as chief of staff of the IDF Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, have all taken responsibility to some extent for failures that led to the attacks.

The International Criminal Court prosecutor Karim Khan told CNN on Sunday that anyone who targets civilian infrastructure in the Israel-Gaza conflict will need to ""justify every strike.”
""What I can say, clearly, is the willful killing and hostage-taking are great breeches of the Geneva Conventions,"" Khan said. ""In all circumstances, human objects have to be protected, unless you can establish that they've lost their protection,"" he continued. 
Khan said civilian targets, such as a “house or school or hospital or a church or a mosque,” are required to be protected under international law unless they become military objectives. 
He said to determine whether those targets are military objectives is “complex” and will require analysis and information. 
""You've got to prove that — you can't assume it. And the burden of proof is on the person that is firing at, or targeting the dwelling house, or the school or the hospital or the church or the mosque,” Khan outlined.
The prosecutor also warned that denying humanitarian assistance to civilians is a crime.
""I think that's, again, a matter that needs urgent consideration by Israel — to make sure that food and medicine go to children and women and men,"" Khan said.
He suggested that, even if a child were to survive an attack initially, a subsequent lack of medical care may mean dire consequences. 
""What kind of hope does a baby have, does a child have, to medical care if there's no anesthetic? If there's no morphine? If there's no medicine?"" he asked.
""Whether a child is born Jewish in Israel or is a Christian or Muslim in Gaza — they're children and we should have that sense of humanity — that legal, ethical, moral responsibility to do right by them,"" Khan stated. 
More background: The ICC is an independent organization based in The Hague in the Netherlands and is not part of the United Nations system. Under Article 5 of the Rome Statute, the ICC has jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. 
However, the ICC can only exercise jurisdiction over crimes if they were committed on the territory of a country that is a member — or by one of its nationals.
Israel is not party to the Rome Statute.
There have been some case-by-case exceptions. A state that is not party to the ICC can make a declaration to accept the jurisdiction of the ICC, and the United Nations Security Council can refer situation to the ICC even if the UN member state is not party to the statute.

86274,35466,"Five armed Palestinian groups joined Hamas in the deadly 7 October attack on Israel after training together in military-style exercises from 2020 onwards, BBC News analysis shows.
The groups carried out joint drills in Gaza which closely resembled the tactics used during the deadly assault - including at a site less than 1km (0.6 miles) from the barrier with Israel - and posted them on social media. 
They practised hostage-taking, raiding compounds and breaching Israel's defences during these exercises, the last of which was held just 25 days before the attack.
BBC Arabic and BBC Verify have collated evidence which shows how Hamas brought together Gaza's factions to hone their combat methods - and ultimately execute a raid into Israel which has plunged the region into war. 
On 29 December 2020, Hamas's overall leader Ismail Haniyeh declared the first of four drills codenamed Strong Pillar a ""strong message and a sign of unity"" between Gaza's various armed factions.
As the most powerful of Gaza's armed groups, Hamas was the dominant force in a coalition which brought together 10 other Palestinian factions in a war games-style exercise overseen by a ""joint operation room"".
The structure was set up in 2018 to coordinate Gaza's armed factions under a central command. 
Prior to 2018, Hamas had formally coordinated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Gaza's second largest armed faction and - like Hamas - a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries.
Hamas had also fought alongside other groups in previous conflicts, but the 2020 drill was billed in propaganda as evidence a wider array of groups were being unified.
Hamas's leader said the first drill reflected the ""permanent readiness"" of the armed factions.
The 2020 exercise was the first of four joint drills held over three years, each of which was documented in polished videos posted on public social media channels. 
The BBC has visually identified 10 groups, including PIJ, by their distinctive headbands and emblems training alongside Hamas during the Strong Pillar drills in footage posted on the messaging app Telegram.
Following the 7 October attack, five of the groups went on to post videos claiming to show them taking part in the assault. Three others issued written statements on Telegram claiming to have participated. 
The role of these groups has come into sharp focus as pressure builds on Hamas to find dozens of women and children believed to have been taken as captives from Israel into Gaza by other factions on 7 October.
Three groups - PIJ, the Mujahideen Brigades and Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades - claim to have seized Israeli hostages, alongside Hamas, on that day. 
Efforts to extend the temporary truce in Gaza were said to be hinging on Hamas locating those hostages.
While these groups are drawn from a broad ideological spectrum ranging from hard-line Islamist to relatively secular, all shared a willingness to use violence against Israel.
Hamas statements repeatedly stressed the theme of unity between Gaza's disparate armed groups. The group suggested they were equal partners in the joint drills, whilst it continued to play a leading role in the plans to attack Israel.
Footage from the first drill shows masked commanders in a bunker appearing to conduct the exercise, and begins with a volley of rocket fire.
It cuts to heavily armed fighters overrunning a mocked-up tank marked with an Israeli flag, detaining a crew member and dragging him away as a prisoner, as well as raiding buildings. 
We know from videos and harrowing witness statements that both tactics were used to capture soldiers and target civilians on 7 October, when around 1,200 people were killed and an estimated 240 hostages were taken.
The second Strong Pillar drill was held almost exactly one year later.
Ayman Nofal, a commander in the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - the official name for Hamas's armed wing - said the aim of the exercise on 26 December 2021 was to ""affirm the unity of the resistance factions"".
He said the drills would ""tell the enemy that the walls and engineering measures on the borders of Gaza will not protect them"".
Another Hamas statement said the ""joint military manoeuvres"" were designed to ""simulate the liberation of settlements near Gaza"" - which is how the group refers to Israeli communities.
The exercise was repeated on 28 December 2022, and propaganda images of fighters practising clearing buildings and overrunning tanks in what appears to be a replica of a military base were published to mark the event.
The exercises were reported on in Israel, so it's inconceivable they were not being closely monitored by the country's extensive intelligence agencies.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have previously carried out air strikes to disrupt Hamas's training activities. In April 2023, they bombed the site used for the first Strong Pillar drill. 
Weeks before the attacks, female surveillance soldiers near the Gaza border reportedly warned of unusually high drone activity and that Hamas was training to take over observation posts with replicas of their positions.
But, according to reports in the Israeli media, they say they were ignored.
Brigadier General Amir Avivi, a former IDF deputy commander in Gaza, told the BBC:  ""There was a lot of intelligence that they were doing this training - after all, the videos are public, and this was happening just hundreds of metres from the fence (with Israel).""
But he said while the military knew about the drills, they ""didn't see what they were training for"".
The IDF said they ""eliminated"" Nofal on 17 October 2023, the first senior Hamas military leader to be killed during the conflict. 
Hamas went to great lengths to make sure the drills were realistic.
In 2022, fighters practised storming a mock Israeli military base built just 2.6km (1.6 miles) from the Erez crossing, a route between Gaza and Israel controlled by the IDF.
BBC Verify has pinpointed the site in the far north of Gaza, just 800m (0.5 miles) from the barrier, by matching geographic features seen in the training footage to aerial images of the area. As of November 2023, the site was still visible on Bing Maps.
The training camp was within 1.6km (1 mile) of an Israeli observation tower and an elevated observation box, elements in a security barrier Israel has spent hundreds of millions of dollars constructing.
The mock base is on land dug several metres below ground level, so it may not have been immediately visible to any nearby Israeli patrols - but the smoke rising from the explosions surely would have been, and the IDF is known to use aerial surveillance. 
Hamas used this site to practise storming buildings, taking hostages at gunpoint and destroying security barriers.
BBC Verify has used publicly available information - including satellite imagery - to locate 14 training sites at nine different locations across Gaza.
They even trained twice at a site less than 1.6 km (1 mile) from the United Nations' aid agency distribution centre, and which was visible in the background of an official video published by the agency in December 2022.
On 10 September 2023, the so-called joint committee room published images on its dedicated Telegram channel of men in military uniforms carrying out surveillance of military installations along the Gaza barrier.
Two days later, the fourth Strong Pillar military exercise was staged, and by 7 October, all the tactics that would be deployed in the unprecedented attack had been rehearsed.
Fighters were filmed riding in the same type of white Toyota pickup trucks which were seen roaming through southern Israel the following month.
The propaganda video shows gunmen raiding mock buildings and firing at dummy targets inside, as well as training to storm a beach using a boat and underwater divers. Israel has said it repelled attempted Hamas boat landings on its shores on 7 October.
However, Hamas did not publicise its training with motorcycles and paragliders as part of the Strong Pillar propaganda. 
A training video posted by Hamas three days after 7 October shows fences and barriers being demolished to allow motorcycles to pass through, a tactic they used to reach communities in southern Israel. We have not identified similar earlier videos.
Footage of fighters using paragliding equipment was also not published until the 7 October attack was under way.  
In a training video shared on the day of the attack, gunmen are seen landing in a mock kibbutz at an airstrip we have located to a site north of Rafah in southern Gaza.
BBC Verify established it was recorded some time before 25 August 2022, and was stored in a computer file titled Eagle Squadron, the name Hamas uses for its aerial division - suggesting the paragliders plan was in the works for over a year. 
Before 7 October, Hamas was thought to have about 30,000 fighters in the Gaza Strip, according to reports quoting IDF commanders. It was also thought that Hamas could draw on several thousands of fighters from smaller groups.
Hamas is by far the most powerful of the Palestinian armed groups, even without the support of other factions - suggesting its interest in galvanising the factions was driven by an attempt to secure broad support within Gaza at least as much as bolstering its own numbers.
The IDF has previously estimated 1,500 fighters joined the 7 October raids. The  Times of Israel reported earlier this month the IDF now believes the number was closer to 3,000.
Whatever the true number, it means only a relatively small fraction of the total number of armed operatives in Gaza took part. It is not possible to verify precise numbers for how many fighters from smaller groups took part in the attack or the Strong Pillar drills.
While Hamas was building cross-faction support in the build-up to the attack, Hisham Jaber, a former Brigadier General in the Lebanese army who is now a security analyst at the Middle East Centre for Studies and Research, said he believed only Hamas was aware of the ultimate plan, and it was ""probable [they] asked other factions to join on the day"".
Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer in security studies at Kings College London, told the BBC: ""While there was centralised planning, execution was de-centralised, with each squad operationalising the plan as they saw fit.""
He said people inside Hamas were said to be surprised by the weakness of Israel's defences, and assessed militants had likely bypassed Israel's surveillance technology by communicating offline. 
Hugh Lovatt, a Middle East analyst at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Israel would have been aware of the joint training drills but ""reached the wrong conclusion"", assessing they amounted to the ""standard"" activity of paramilitary groups in the Palestinian territories, rather than being ""indicative of a looming large-scale attack"".
Asked about the issues raised in this article, the Israel Defense Forces said it was ""currently focused on eliminating the threat from the terrorist organisation Hamas"" and questions about any potential failures ""will be looked into in a later stage"".
It could be several years until Israel formally reckons with whether it missed opportunities to prevent the 7 October massacre.
The ramifications for its military, intelligence services and government could be seismic.
