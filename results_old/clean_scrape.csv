This video can not be played The BBC's Wyre Davies said it was a ""devastating night"" for the Socialists The opposition in Venezuela has won a majority of seats in the National Assembly, overturning nearly two decades of dominance by the Socialists of President Nicolas Maduro. Five hours after polling ended, the National Electoral Council announced the opposition had won 99 seats. President Maduro has admitted defeat, recognising ""these adverse results"". It is the worst-ever defeat for the leftist movement founded by former leader Hugo Chavez in 1999. The Socialists have gained 46 seats, with another 22 yet to be declared. Results arrived much later than expected, five hours after polls closed. Fireworks erupted over the capital, Caracas, soon after. Among the campaign issues were chronic food shortages of staples - such as milk, rice, coffee, sugar, corn flour and cooking oil. Venezuela has been hit hard by the continuing low price of oil, its main export. It also has the continent's highest inflation rate. Mr Maduro has blamed the situation on an ""economic war"" waged by the opposition. ""We have come with our morals and our ethics [intact] to recognize these adverse results, to accept them and to say to our Venezuela that the constitution and democracy have triumphed. ""We have lost a battle today, but the struggle to build a new society is just beginning."" - Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's president and head of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela. ""The results are as we hoped. Venezuela has won. It's irreversible,"" tweeted (in Spanish) Henrique Capriles, a leading opposition figure in the Democratic Unity Roundtable and a former presidential challenger. ""Venezuela wanted a change and that change came. A new majority expressed itself and sent a clear and resounding message."" - Jesus Torrealba - opposition coalition chief. The opposition alliance, made up of centrist and conservative parties, is confident of ultimately taking at least 112 seats after 16 years of socialist control. According to senior figures in the alliance, that would allow them to pass laws allowing the release of political prisoners and to reverse, for example, appointments to senior legal positions made by the current government, says the BBC's Wyre Davies, in Caracas. It also gives stronger momentum to the opposition should it wish to call a referendum on Mr Maduro's future. This could take place only when his presidency reaches its halfway point in April next year. However, under Venezuela's presidential system the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) will still be a powerful force, as it controls many municipalities. The next presidential election is due in April 2019. The elections were widely seen as a referendum on President Maduro, the handpicked successor of the late President Hugo Chavez, and the party's socialist policies. The opposition accused the PSUV of mismanaging the economy and of squandering the country's oil wealth. Mr Maduro says his party defends the interests of ordinary Venezuelans and wants to complete Mr Chavez's ""Bolivarian Revolution"". The opposition also accused the government of increasing authoritarianism. Earlier this year, opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez was given a 13-year prison sentence for inciting violence - a charge critics say was politically motivated.

Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro has won re-election to another six-year term, in a vote marred by an opposition boycott and claims of vote-rigging. Amid food shortages stemming from a severe economic crisis turnout was low. The National Electoral Council (CNE) put it at just 46% but the opposition alleges it was even lower. The main opposition candidate, Henri Falcón, rejected the result soon after the polls closed and called for new elections.  ""We do not recognise this electoral process as valid... we have to have new elections in Venezuela,"" he said. With more than 90% of the votes counted, Mr Maduro had 67.7% - 5.8 million votes - CNE chief Tibisay Lucena announced. Mr Falcón had won 21.2% - 1.8 million votes - she said. With Venezuela's main opposition coalition boycotting the election, a win by President Maduro had been widely expected. What observers were more interested in was to see how many Venezuelans would turn out to vote. The CNE said turnout would probably rise to 48%, still well below the figure in the 2013 presidential election, when almost 80% of eligible voters cast their ballots. The opposition, however, accused the CNE of inflating its figures and claimed the real number was closer to 30%. A source within the CNE told Reuters that only 32.3% of eligible voters had cast their ballot by 18:00 local time, when most voting stations closed.  Under the Venezuelan constitution, the CNE is the official independent body responsible for overseeing and guaranteeing the transparency of all elections.  It is made up of five members. The opposition alleges that four of the five are government stooges and therefore does not trust the body to be independent. Luis Emilio Rondón, the one CNE member which has been critical of the government, said he did not recognise the results because ""Venezuelans' freedom to vote"" had not been respected.   Mr Maduro and his supporters were jubilant. The 55 year old told cheering crowds outside the presidential palace in Caracas that ""the revolution is here to stay!"". His supporters chanted ""let's go, Nico!"" as fireworks went off and confetti was fired in the air. He also mocked his main rival, Mr Falcón, saying he had been left ""groggy"" by the knockout victory Mr Maduro had achieved.   And while on the one hand he called for dialogue with the opposition, he also told supporters that ""the opposition must leave us alone to govern"". Previous attempts at dialogue between the opposition and the government have failed.  The main opposition coalition had warned that the election would not be free and fair. It said the poll had been brought forward from December 2018 to take advantage of disarray within opposition ranks and that some of the most promising candidates had been banned from standing or jailed, while many others had fled the country.  That is why it called for a boycott. Mr Falcón however broke ranks, arguing Venezuelans should be given a chance to vote Mr Maduro out of office. But following the vote, he too alleged it had been rigged in Mr Maduro's favour, by abuse of the scanning of state-issued benefits cards used for accessing food. He has called for a rerun. By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent, Caracas Such was the expectation that Nicolás Maduro would win that his rivals admitted defeat, denouncing the result before it had even been announced. There was never going to be any result other than a Maduro victory - and Venezuelans knew that.  It feels like most people here are no longer outraged. Disappointed, maybe, but it's par for the course in a country where political freedom feels increasingly limited.  Mr Maduro has promised change in Venezuela - why he needed a second mandate to do that is anyone's guess. He's already been in the job five years. Added to that, change for the better under Mr Maduro is unlikely. With international pressure likely to build after these results, and with a crumbling economy, his job is harder than ever - as are the lives of Venezuelans. As polling started, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denounced the election as a ""sham"" on Twitter. The US mission to the United Nations called the process an ""insult to democracy"" and Chile and Panama said that they would not recognise the result.   El Salvador and Cuba, on the other hand, congratulated President Maduro on his election win. All eyes are now on the US to see whether it will impose sanctions on Venezuela's all-important oil sector, as it has threatened to do. The European Union and Latin American countries had also warned ahead of the vote that they would take measures against the government if it went ahead with the election. The exodus of Venezuelans leaving their country is expected to speed up further. According to International Office of Migration figures, the number of Venezuelans living abroad increased to an estimated 1.6 million in 2017 from 700,000 in 2015.  They have been driven out by Venezuela's severe economic crisis which has led to shortages of food and medicine and the world's highest inflation rate. Those leaving speak of the struggle to feed their families and growing levels of child malnutrition which have hit 70% in some rural areas. Copyright 2023 BBC.

Jesus Maria Casal, president of Venezuela's opposition's National Primary Commission, leaves after a meeting with Elvis Hidrobo Amoroso, head of Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE), in Caracas, Venezuela September 25, 2023. REUTERS/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights CARACAS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition election commission said on Monday it will move forward with its late October primary vote to pick its presidential candidate for next year's general election, after the country's national electoral council sought a delay. The South American nation's beleaguered political opposition will face off against President Nicolas Maduro's ruling socialists, who have presided over a prolonged economic meltdown marked by sky-high inflation and persecution of critics, according to rights groups. Maduro is expected to run for re-election, but has not yet made a formal announcement. Last month, the National Electoral Council (CNE) - seen by the opposition as aligned with Maduro - responded to a June request to assist with the opposition's primary, saying it could provide voting centers and machines but stressing more time was needed to help organize the primary vote for later in November. But most of the 13 opposition candidates rejected this request, preferring to keep the Oct. 22 primary, while criticizing what they called a slow CNE response. The opposition commission - made up of eight lawyers and experts - said it had asked for up to 400 additional voting centers as well as security at the centers and help facilitating visas for electoral experts and foreign journalists covering the process. In its own statement later on Monday, the CNE insisted it holds ""exclusive competency"" to organize elections but would provide technical support to the opposition ""to guarantee a reliable, transparent process"" that promotes participation and security. The statement did not address the primary election's date. Venezuela's opposition counts some 3,000 voting centers, according to commission president Jesus Maria Casal. Some 14,000 Venezuelan schools typically serve as electoral centers for the country's 20 million voters, but since the primary is being carried out independently, these cannot be used without CNE authorization. Venezuelan authorities have in recent months disqualified some opposition candidates, including former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado, the opposition's leading hopeful in polls.

Acquire Licensing Rights Read more CARACAS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado is leading the vote count in the Venezuelan opposition's presidential primary by a huge margin and has claimed victory in the Sunday contest, with final results pending. The vote to choose a unity opposition candidate to face President Nicolas Maduro in his probable re-election bid next year came amid pledges by the United States to roll back sanctions relief if the government fails to lift bans preventing some opposition figures from holding office. Machado was tallying 93% of the vote, with just over 26% of ballot boxes counted, the primary's organizing commission said around midnight. ""From tonight we begin a great movement for a great national alliance for the transformation of Venezuela,"" Machado said at her campaign headquarters. ""Today I received a mandate and I accept with Venezuelans the commitment of making that mandate matter."" The count - delayed by a server blockage - was expected to resume later on Monday. It was unclear when the next results update would be given. Machado's nearest rival, former lawmaker Carlos Prosperi, had 4.75% of the vote. Participation in the vote, organized without state help, was more than double what had been expected in some states. Venezuela has about 20 million eligible voters. Polling places - including in private homes and on street corners - were meant to close at 4 p.m. (2000 GMT), but many remained opened hours later, so those waiting in long lines could vote or so additional ballots could be delivered. Some of the estimated 3,000 polling locations nationwide had to be moved, according to human rights groups and voters, causing confusion. Voters also faced transportation problems. Gasoline availability was limited in border states Tachira and Bolivar and public transport in the country's interior was working irregularly, according to Reuters witnesses. ""On Friday we waited in three lines to be able to get gasoline for today and we couldn't,"" said housewife Melissa Diaz, 39, who arrived at her polling place in eastern Guyana City with a nearly empty tank. ""We've lost a whole day, but even if we had to walk or cycle, we were coming to vote."" Machado, 56, an industrial engineer, has led her rivals by some 40 points in polls. But Machado, like two former rivals who dropped out of the race, is barred from public office over her support of the sanctions on Maduro's government and would not be able to register for the general election. The opposition and government this week signed a deal on some election guarantees, including the presence of international observers. The accord allows each side to choose its candidate according to internal rules, but did not retract the election disqualifications. The United States, which broadly eased Trump-era sanctions on Venezuelan oil and gas and bonds in response to the deal, has said Maduro has until the end of November to begin rescinding the bans and releasing political prisoners and ""wrongfully detained"" Americans. Though five people were released, lead government negotiator Jorge Rodriguez confirmed this week that those with disqualifications cannot run in the 2024 contest, set for the second half of the year. Some in the opposition have said they are skeptical Maduro will follow through on the deal. The opposition, which says the disqualifications are unlawful, has been reticent to say what it would do if Machado wins the primary but is unable to compete in 2024. Machado - who says her goal is to remove Maduro in a fair and peaceful vote - has said she would pressure the electoral authorities to let her register. Maduro has not announced that he will seek re-election, but many observers expect him to run. Others have argued selecting a substitute candidate would be necessary, although whether the often-fractious opposition would accept Machado choosing a replacement remains to be seen. Ten candidates are competing in the primary, where candidates have pledged to come up with solutions for the country's long economic crisis. ""If you buy diapers you don't buy food, so I buy food and not diapers,"" said 20-year-old hairdresser Rosimar Gonzalez, who voted in central Maracay with her young son in her arms. ""We have to change presidents."" About 4 million of the 7.7 million Venezuelans migrants who have left their country are estimated to be of voting age and are able to vote at centers in 28 countries. ""I came to vote because I want to hug my grandchildren again, because I want to see my country on the road to freedom before I go,"" said a teary Armando Cedeno, 100, who voted in the afternoon in Maracaibo. ""I am confident that God will give me that gift.""

CARACAS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Venezuela's Supreme Justice Tribunal said on Monday it has suspended the results of an opposition presidential primary that took place this month, despite an electoral deal between the government and the opposition that allows each side to choose its candidate. The ruling could risk the wrath of the United States, which this month rolled back some oil and gas industry and bond trading sanctions in exchange for the electoral deal. The U.S. State Department has already said it will reinstate sanctions if the government of President Nicolas Maduro does not lift bans on some opposition candidates and free political prisoners and ""wrongfully detained"" Americans by the end of November. The decision by the court, which the opposition considers an arm of the government, comes after the attorney general announced last week that his office is investigating the primary and members of its organizing commission for electoral violations, financial crimes and conspiracy. Members of the organizing commission were meeting with prosecutors on Monday for interviews related to the case, the commission said on social media. The opposition and the primary's winner Maria Corina Machado have insisted repeatedly the Oct. 22 vote was transparent and fair. The government has decried alleged fraud since the day of the vote, which was organized without state help and which attracted more than 2.3 million voters. The government of Maduro, in power for a decade, and the opposition signed an electoral deal in Barbados, agreeing to international observers and that each side can choose its candidate according to internal rules.

""The U.S. government will take action if Maduro and his representatives do not meet their commitments."" Both the investigation and the ruling come at the request of lawmaker Jose Brito, who the court said wanted to participate in the primary. Brito does not belong to any of the parties that took part. ""Following the request of preventative protection and in consequence, all the effects of the distinct phases of the electoral process conducted by the National Primary Commission are suspended,"" the tribunal said on its website. The commission must present all documents related to its creation, candidate registration, voting records and other documents, the tribunal said. The commission must also account for the participation of candidates like Machado, who is barred from holding public office in a decision the opposition says is illegal. The ruling ""temporarily suspends the primary until there is a final decision from the tribunal,"" said lawyer and university professor Jose Vicente Haro. ""The tribunal is late to the decision because it comes after the primary. They shouldn't have accepted the petition."" Some observers said the opposition parties that participated in the primary should simply recognize Machado once again as their unity candidate, making any ruling on the contest moot. The opposition this month declined electoral authorities' offer of help organize the primary, and its request to delay the vote until November, after the authorities took several months to respond to the opposition's request for assistance.

Christopher Booker                       Christopher Booker                   Was it an insurrection? A coup? Should we call it domestic terrorism? Or just a peaceful protest gone awry? As a battle of politics becomes a battle for words to describe what happened in the capital and on Capitol Hill on January 6, 2021, Christopher Booker speaks to Joanne Freeman, a history professor at Yale University about why words used to describe the event today will shape its history. Hari Sreenivasan: There have been many discussions this week over the language used to describe the events in the capital and at the Capitol building this week. NewsHour Weekend's Christopher Booker has more. Christopher Booker: Its hard to find the words to describe what happened on Wednesday. Was it a riot? Was it an insurrection? It certainly was much more than a protest. It's often said journalism is the first rough draft of history… But what impact will the words we are using have on the way America remembers what happened in Washington this week? Joanne Freeman: Even just to describe the attack on the Capitol, know are they rioters or was it a mob? Is it terrorism? Is it insurrection? Is it a coup? Christopher Booker: Joanne Freeman is a professor of history at Yale University who specializes in the politics and political culture of the revolutionary and early national periods of American history. She has written extensively about turmoil in American politics. Joanne Freeman: One of the striking things about words right now is that in many ways, I think Americans don't quite have the words to describe what's going on. This morning, I saw some people referring to what happened on Wednesday as the storming of the Capitol. And I actually object to that because storming romanticizes it, there's nothing romantic about what happened. It's not just born of passions, noble passions. It was an act with implications and repercussions. It was an attack on the government. Some people with violence in mind, it was an attack on a symbol of government that has a deep impact and above and beyond the fact that it forced members of Congress to flee in all of these ways. It's not just a peaceful expression of passion. Christopher Booker: Yet 'passion' is a word often used. Ted Cruz: We gather together at a moment of division, at a moment of great passion. Christopher Booker: Senator Ted Cruz reaching for it on the Senate floor as he lodged objections to the state vote certifications on Wednesday. Joanne Freeman: Speaking as a historian who's always interested in the meaning of words in the past, in the right context, we're in one of those moments that 50 years from now, historians will look at us grappling to find the right language to talk about this moment. Now, the other thing about language in this moment, you know, fascism, socialism, communism, even democracy, liberty, freedom, patriotism. Donald Trump: Looking out at all the amazing patriots here today, I have never been more confident in our nation's future. Joanne Freeman We're in a battle of words as well as a battle of politics, particularly  when you have extreme circumstances like we're experiencing right now, those kinds of words can be used as masks to mask extremism: This is democracy! This is liberty, this is freedom! Now, here's the thing, and it's going to sound obvious, but I think it's important to realize in a democratic form of government, a democracy is grounded on public sentiment and public opinion. That's really basically where the power is. A pronouncement made from on high, meaning the national stage, a congressman, a president. Those words have added meaning and those words can be taken and are almost always taken seriously by some of the public. Christopher Booker: It's interesting because they the words and the way the words are being used are also being used, I assume, to recruit more among the far-right. For instance, I'm thinking of tweets that we saw Instagram postings of revolutionaries inside the capital, patriots taking back the people's house. Joanne Freeman: Right. Revolutionaries, people are grabbing at moments in the past out of context and using them to frame what they're doing right. This is supremely American. Our revolutionaries did it. We are just like them. That's what we're doing. And on the surface, you can happily sort of nod along with that. If you actually look at the reality of what happened during the revolution, what happened now and what these people are doing, no, that's not an easy comparison to make and the problem with that and this is the problem of propaganda. How do you, how do you disprove that? Right. How do you I can say people who attack the Capitol aren't patriots. That's unpatriotic. How what do I say? If someone says, no, I feel very patriotic, I'm defending government as I see it, that's a hard these words are powerful for a reason because they're hard to refute. They're fuzzy and they have a gut impact and a profound political meaning. Now that leads to another point, which is, there has to be accountability in a broad way right now, because if there isn't, the message is clearly, well, that was fine, that was OK. And why if you were someone who engaged in that kind of behavior and there's no impact of any kind and there's no consequences, why would you not do that again?

Skip to content or footer   		Protesters swarmed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday as Congress met to formally ratify Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election. 		Jack Gruber, USA TODAY  This story was updated Feb. 8. A previous version originally published Jan. 6. Former President Donald Trump faces his second impeachment trial in the Senate, charged with inciting an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. The House of Representatives impeached Trump on the charges last month and oral arguments in the trial are scheduled to begin Tuesday.. Though the article includes events beyond Jan. 6 – including Trump pressuring Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn the election results in a recorded phone call — Trump's attorneys argue that he did not incite the crowd the day of the attack, noting that law enforcement says it was planned ahead of time. The events of Jan. 6 shocked a nation watching it unfold on Twitter and TV. A pro-Trump mob battled police, broke into the U.S. Capitol, and sent members of Congress fleeing as lawmakers were counting Electoral College votes to confirm the presidential victory of Democrat Joe Biden. Now, five people are dead, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer. Many of the rioters came directly from President Donald Trump’s “Save America Rally” that began hours earlier on the Ellipse, a park near the White House. Trump spoke to them for more than an hour, insisting that the election had been stolen. “Our country has had enough,” Trump said. “We will not take it anymore, and that’s what this is all about. To use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with, we will stop the steal.” When he was finished, supporters headed for the Capitol building. Here is how events unfolded. Times are estimates. Crowds of Trump supporters, estimated in the thousands, prepare for a pro-Trump rally near the Ellipse. Many began gathering the night before. Trump tweeted about the rally on Dec. 19: ""Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!"" Trump’s “Save America Rally” begins first with the president's sons Eric and Donald Trump Jr., then his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani. Trump starts speaking at about 11:50 a.m. and speaks for more than an hour. Trump tells the crowd to head to the Capitol and that “you’ll never take back our country with weakness.”  Lawmakers gather for a joint session in the House of Representatives chamber to count Electoral College votes. Around the end of his speech, Trump returns to the idea of fighting for the country and urged those assembled to walk to the Capitol. “We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,” Trump said. “So we are going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue – I love Pennsylvania Avenue – and we are going to the Capitol.” Rioters begin grappling with police on the Capitol steps. Capitol police order evacuation of Library of Congress, Madison Building and Cannon House Office Building on Independence Avenue across from the Capitol. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser orders citywide curfew starting at 6 p.m. Wednesday and ending at 6 a.m. Thursday. CNN reports District police are asking for more law enforcement. Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., tweets she is being evacuated after reports of a pipe bomb outside. “Supporters of the President are trying to force their way into the Capitol and I can hear what sounds like multiple gunshots."" Rioters breach police lines on the west side of the Capitol. Moments later, rioters scale the walls. Reports say Vice President Mike Pence has been escorted out of the Senate chamber. Trump tweets, “Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!” C-SPAN reports rioters have crossed Statuary Hall, the chamber that separates the House and Senate, heading for the House and Senate. Trump tweets, ""Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful!"" Rioters are photographed breaking Capitol windows. Shots are reported fired in the House chamber. Huffington Post reporter tweets image of rioters at dais. “They’re in the chamber.” Rep. Alex Mooney, R-W.Va., tweets he has been safely moved from the House chamber. He says he and others were given an escape hood, a respiratory hood and mask for protection in fires or chemical accidents. Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tennessee, texts “shots fired.” Rioters are photographed on the Senate floor. Trump tweets: “I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order – respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!” CBS reports a woman is in critical condition after being shot in the neck inside the Capitol. Police later report the woman died. She was identified as Ashli Babbitt, 35, an Air Force veteran. Her husband was quoted as saying she was a strong supporter of Trump. In an account to WUSA9, a purported witness explains what happened, saying they had stormed the building and she was climbing through the window. He says armed police and Secret Service repeatedly warned to get back, but ""she didn't heed the call,"" and then they shot her. The District of Columbia National Guard, about 1,100 troops, is mobilized to support local law enforcement. A congressional correspondent tweets that congressional leaders are being evacuated from the Capitol. In a tweeted video lasting just over a minute, Trump says, in part: “I know your pain. I know you’re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it, especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. ...  So go home. We love you, you’re very special. ... I know","(2021, 1, 6)"

Former US President Donald Trump has been charged with plotting to overturn his 2020 election defeat. He is accused of four counts including conspiracy to defraud the US, tampering with a witness and conspiracy against the rights of citizens. The indictment caps an inquiry into events which led up to the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol - when supporters of Mr Trump stormed Congress in a bid to thwart the certification of Joe Biden's election victory. Mr Trump, who is again running for president, denies wrongdoing. Here are the key moments from 6 January 2021. President Donald Trump tweets allegations of vote fraud ahead of his rally in Washington DC.  Members of the Proud Boy movement, a right-wing militia, are seen heading towards the Capitol. Speaking to Newsnight's US correspondent David Grossman, one member of the group says: ""We're taking our country back.""  One of the group has a radio. ""It was clear he was communicating - getting messages, sending messages to somebody,"" our correspondent said.  President Trump begins his speech to supporters in Washington. Some 15 minutes into it, he starts urging them to converge on the Capitol.  ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard,"" he said.  As the president speaks, a crowd outside the Capitol is swelling. They begin marching towards the police barrier and get past officers. The police, outnumbered, try to contain them.  Trump supporters wield flags and weapons. One man stands on a makeshift gallows, complete with a noose. The crowd chants: ""Fight for Trump.""  Minutes later, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi commences the certification process.  Mr Trump ends his speech with the words: ""We fight. We fight like hell and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. So let's walk down Pennsylvania Avenue."" Shortly afterwards a Capitol police officer calls for backup.  ""They're throwing metal poles at us,"" he says. ""Multiple law-enforcement injuries,"" he adds in a panicked voice.  Capitol police send an evacuation warning.  Protesters surge past Capitol police protecting the west steps, the side facing the White House.  Minutes later, an officer declares there is a riot at the Capitol.  ""We're going to give riot warnings,"" he says. ""We're going to try to get compliance but this is now effectively a riot."" Meanwhile Vice President Mike Pence is continuing to preside over the session.  Secret Service quickly and suddenly evacuate Mr Pence from the Senate floor.  The protesters break through the windows. They push inside, hopping through the broken glass. They then kick open the doors to let others in. Some wear hoods and helmets, some hold cameras or Confederate flags. An immediate recess of the Senate is called.  A minute later, Officer Eugene Goodman runs to respond to the initial breach. He warns Senator Mitt Romney that the mob is approaching. Mr Romney turns and runs through a capitol hallway to safety.  The mob, a floor below them, has already begun to search for the Senate chamber.  Officer Goodman makes his way down to the first floor where he encounters the mob.  He lures the armed rioters away from the upper chamber. Many of these individuals have been calling for Mr Pence to be hanged. By that point, the rioters are ""within 100ft"" (30m) of Mr Pence and a foot away from one of the doors to the chamber. Many senators are still inside.  At the same time, Ms Pelosi is rushed from the house floor. She is evacuated entirely from the Capitol complex to a secure off-site location.  Her staff barricade themselves into a conference room, hiding under a table.  Staff members of the House leader speak softly, frantically, to each other. Just outside, rioters are spreading out across the building, searching for Ms Pelosi herself. The rioters chant: ""Where are you Nancy?"" In an audio clip, we hear one staff member whisper: ""They're pounding on doors trying to find her."" One man breaks open the outer door to the office where the staff are hiding, but not the inner door. Another tries as well, but eventually moves on. President Trump tweets about Mr Pence.  At the same time, Mr Pence is evacuated to a secure location.  Rioters start to spread through the buildings. Others break in from outside through various doors around the building.  They open the east side door of the rotunda to let more people in, flooding through the doors and overwhelming the officers.  The House floor debate is suspended to update members. House members are told to reach for tear gas masks and be prepared to use them.  The House is called back into session in the hope of continuing the count.  But minutes later the House is abruptly recessed. Members are told to get down under their chairs if necessary.  ""Folks have entered the rotunda and are coming this way,"" lawmakers are told.  Democratic Congressman Eric Swalwell sends a text to his wife: ""I love you and the babies. Please hug them for me"".  The mob outside the chamber grows larger and they get within feet of the house door.  President Trump called Senator Mike Lee, according to the Utah Republican who has provided the trial lawyers with a copy of a log from his mobile phone. According to his office, he received a call from the White House switchboard number - and the call lasted four minutes. Mr Lee has said that apparently the call was meant for Alabama senator Tommy Tuberville, and that he handed his phone to his colleague. Mr Tuberville told reporters that he informed Mr Trump that Mr Pence had been evacuated from the Senate floor. ""I said: Mr President, they've taken the vice-president out. They want me to get off the","(2021, 2, 9)"

His comments are a key part of the impeachment trial against him. Former President Donald Trump's remarks on the Ellipse on Jan. 6, urging his supporters to march on the Capitol as Congress was certifying the results of November's presidential election, are a key part of the case against Trump being made by House impeachment managers and are also being used by the lawyers who are defending him. The House managers in Trump's Senate impeachment trial have already shown clips from the speech, in which Trump outlined a long list of grievances against the news media and against Republicans he deemed were insufficiently supportive, as well as a litany of false claims about how the election had been stolen from him. Democrats have pointed to one phrase in particular as they argue that Trump incited those present to march down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol.  ""We fight like hell. And if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore,"" he said. His defense lawyers, however, point to a different passage, in which Trump said, ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard."" They argue that his words were not a call for actual violence and lawlessness.  Read Trump's remarks in full below, as published by The Associated Press. Editor's note: The video contains profanity. Well, thank you very much. This is incredible. Media will not show the magnitude of this crowd. Even I, when I turned on today, I looked, and I saw thousands of people here. But you don't see hundreds of thousands of people behind you because they don't want to show that. We have hundreds of thousands of people here and I just want them to be recognized by the fake news media. Turn your cameras please and show what's really happening out here because these people are not going to take it any longer. They're not going to take it any longer. Go ahead. Turn your cameras, please. Would you show? They came from all over the world, actually, but they came from all over our country. I just really want to see what they do. I just want to see how they covered. I've never seen anything like it. But it would be really great if we could be covered fairly by the media. The media is the biggest problem we have as far as I'm concerned, single biggest problem. The fake news and the Big tech. Big tech is now coming into their own. We beat them four years ago. We surprised them. We took them by surprise and this year they rigged an election. They rigged it like they've never rigged an election before. And by the way, last night they didn't do a bad job either if you notice. I'm honest. And I just, again, I want to thank you. It's just a great honor to have this kind of crowd and to be before you and hundreds of thousands of American patriots who are committed to the honesty of our elections and the integrity of our glorious republic. All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical-left Democrats, which is what they're doing. And stolen by the fake news media. That's what they've done and what they're doing. We will never give up, we will never concede. It doesn't happen. You don't concede when there's theft involved. Our country has had enough. We will not take it anymore and that's what this is all about. And to use a favorite term that all of you people really came up with: We will stop the steal. Today I will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election and we won it by a landslide. This was not a close election. You know, I say, sometimes jokingly, but there's no joke about it: I've been in two elections. I won them both and the second one, I won much bigger than the first. OK. Almost 75 million people voted for our campaign, the most of any incumbent president by far in the history of our country, 12 million more people than four years ago. And I was told by the real pollsters — we do have real pollsters — they know that we were going to do well and we were going to win. What I was told, if I went from 63 million, which we had four years ago, to 66 million, there was no chance of losing. Well, we didn't go to 66, we went to 75 million, and they say we lost. We didn't lose. And by the way, does anybody believe that Joe had 80 million votes?","(2021, 2, 10)"

clockThis article was published more than 2 years ago Relief flowed through Facebook in the days after the 2020 presidential election. The company had cracked down on misinformation, foreign interference and hate speech — and employees believed they had largely succeeded in limiting problems that, four years earlier, had brought on perhaps the most serious crisis in Facebook’s scandal-plagued history. “It was like we could take a victory lap,” said a former employee, one of many who spoke for this story on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive matters. “There was a lot of the feeling of high-fiving in the office.” Many who had worked on the election, exhausted from months of unrelenting toil, took leaves of absence or moved on to other jobs. Facebook rolled back many of the dozens of election-season measures that it had used to suppress hateful, deceptive content. A ban the company had imposed on the original Stop the Steal group stopped short of addressing dozens of look-alikes that popped up in what an internal Facebook after-action report, first reported by BuzzFeed News, called “coordinated” and “meteoric” growth. Meanwhile, the company’s Civic Integrity team was largely disbanded by a management that had grown weary of the team’s criticisms of the company, according to former employees. But the high-fives, it soon became clear, were premature. On Jan. 6, Facebook staffers expressed their horror in internal messages as they watched thousands of Trump supporters shouting “stop the steal” and bearing the symbols of QAnon — a violent ideology that had spread widely on Facebook before an eventual crackdown — thronged the U.S. Capitol. Many bashed their way inside and battled to halt the constitutionally mandated certification of President Biden’s election victory. How one of America’s ugliest days unraveled inside and outside the Capitol Measures of online mayhem surged alarmingly on Facebook, with user reports of “false news” hitting nearly 40,000 per hour, an internal report that day showed. On Facebook-owned Instagram, the account reported most often for inciting violence was @realdonaldtrump — the president’s official account, the report showed. Facebook has never publicly disclosed what it knows about how its platforms, including Instagram and WhatsApp, helped fuel that day’s mayhem. The company rejected its own Oversight Board’s recommendation that it study how its policies contributed to the violence and has yet to fully comply with requests for data from the congressional commission investigating the events. But thousands of pages of internal company documents disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission by the whistleblower Frances Haugen offer important new evidence of Facebook’s role in the events. This story is based on those documents, as well as on others independently obtained by The Washington Post, and on interviews with current and former Facebook employees. The documents include outraged posts on Workplace, an internal message system. “This is not a new problem,” one unnamed employee fumed on Workplace on Jan. 6. “We have been watching this behavior from politicians like Trump, and the — at best — wishy washy actions of company leadership, for years now. We have been reading the [farewell] posts from trusted, experienced and loved colleagues who write that they simply cannot conscience working for a company that does not do more to mitigate the negative effects on its platform.” The SEC documents, which were provided to Congress in redacted form by Haugen’s legal counsel and reviewed by The Post and other news organizations, suggest that Facebook moved too quickly after the election to lift measures that had helped suppress some election-related misinformation. The rushed effort to restore them on Jan. 6 was not enough to stop the surge of hateful, violent posts, documents show. A company after-action report concluded that in the weeks after the election, Facebook did not act forcefully enough against the Stop the Steal movement that was pushed by Trump’s political allies, even as its presence exploded across the platform. The documents also provide ample evidence that the company’s internal research over several years had identified ways to diminish the spread of political polarization, conspiracy theories and incitements to violence but that in many instances, executives had declined to implement those steps. Trump allies, largely unconstrained by Facebook’s rules against repeated falsehoods, cement pre-election dominance Facebook officials counter that they planned exhaustively for the election and its aftermath, even anticipating the potential for post-election violence, and always expected the challenges to last through Inauguration Day. They acknowledge rolling back some protective measures in December but said they did so only when measures of problematic content had declined markedly, and that numerous other effective measures remained in place through Jan. 6 and beyond. They laid the blame for the Capitol siege on broader political forces and content that flowed more freely on other online platforms. “The responsibility for the violence that occurred on January 6 lies with those who attacked our Capitol and those who encouraged them,” spokeswoman Dani Lever said in a statement. “We took steps to limit content that sought to delegitimize the election, including labeling candidates’ posts with the latest vote count after Mr. Trump prematurely declared victory, pausing new political advertising and removing the original #StopTheSteal Group in November.” She added, ""After the violence at the Capitol erupted and as we saw continued attempts to organize events to dispute the outcome of the presidential election, we removed content with the phrase ‘stop the steal’ under our Coordinating Harm policy and suspended Trump from our platforms.” But many employees with a close-up view of the company’s actions before and during Jan. 6 emerged from the experience angry and demanding answers. Both feelings were well represented in posts on Workplace and echoed in interviews with The Post. “Never forget the day Trump rode down the escalator in 2015, called for a ban on Muslims entering the US, [and] we determined that it violated our policies, and yet we explicitly overrode the policy and didn’t take the video down,” one wrote bitterly. “There is a straight line that can be drawn from that","(2021, 10, 22)"

""As the Select Committee concludes its work, their words must be a clarion call to all Americans: to vigilantly guard our Democracy and to give our vote only to those dutiful in their defense of our Constitution,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in the report. Despite criminal referrals against him and a mountain of evidence showing otherwise, Trump — now a presidential candidate once again — has continued to post on social media since the report was released to repeat his lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him. In addition to the criminal referrals to the DOJ, the committee laid out 11 recommendations aimed at better protecting the American democratic system from future attacks. Those recommendations include clarifying that the role of the vice president in the transition of power is purely ceremonial and a new federal law enforcement emphasis on anti-government extremist groups.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro speaks during a government rally to mark Youth Day, in Caracas, Venezuela February 12, 2023. REUTERS/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria  Acquire Licensing Rights CARACAS, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition said on Wednesday it will hold a presidential primary on Oct. 22 to choose a candidate to face the ruling party in presidential elections tentatively scheduled for 2024. The primary is the opposition's first since 2012. It hopes to rally supporters after years of futile attempts to unseat the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro, but it faces deep voter apathy, among other challenges. The next move is for the 10-person opposition committee tasked with scheduling the vote to meet with the country's National Electoral Council, Jesus Maria Casal, the head of the council, told journalists. He did not give a date for when that would happen. ""We're going to demand voting centers... it's a question of rights,"" Casal said. At least a dozen people from various opposition parties have said they will run in the primary, including some who are barred from participating in politics by judicial rulings the opposition considers undemocratic. One of those barred is former state governor Henrique Capriles, who won the opposition's last primary over a decade ago, before losing the 2012 presidential vote to late former President Hugo Chavez. Chavez's protege Maduro beat Capriles by a much-narrower margin in another vote in 2013. The main coalition of opposition parties boycotted the 2018 presidential vote when Maduro won re-election, a victory which they and countries including the United States consider fraudulent. Maduro, who is enjoying renewed relations with neighbors Colombia and Brazil and some loosened U.S. restrictions on the oil industry, has not yet set a date for the 2024 vote and has intimated it could be moved earlier. The opposition, which has been repeatedly fractured by in-fighting, recently named a new three-person leadership for their parallel legislature, replacing the former interim government of Juan Guaido.

Jesus Maria Casal, president of Venezuela's opposition's National Primary Commission, leaves after a meeting with Elvis Hidrobo Amoroso, head of Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE), in Caracas, Venezuela September 25, 2023. REUTERS/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights CARACAS, Oct 2 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition election commission said on Monday it will move forward with its late October primary vote to pick its presidential candidate for next year's general election, after the country's national electoral council sought a delay. The South American nation's beleaguered political opposition will face off against President Nicolas Maduro's ruling socialists, who have presided over a prolonged economic meltdown marked by sky-high inflation and persecution of critics, according to rights groups. Maduro is expected to run for re-election, but has not yet made a formal announcement. Last month, the National Electoral Council (CNE) - seen by the opposition as aligned with Maduro - responded to a June request to assist with the opposition's primary, saying it could provide voting centers and machines but stressing more time was needed to help organize the primary vote for later in November. But most of the 13 opposition candidates rejected this request, preferring to keep the Oct. 22 primary, while criticizing what they called a slow CNE response. The opposition commission - made up of eight lawyers and experts - said it had asked for up to 400 additional voting centers as well as security at the centers and help facilitating visas for electoral experts and foreign journalists covering the process. In its own statement later on Monday, the CNE insisted it holds ""exclusive competency"" to organize elections but would provide technical support to the opposition ""to guarantee a reliable, transparent process"" that promotes participation and security. The statement did not address the primary election's date. Venezuela's opposition counts some 3,000 voting centers, according to commission president Jesus Maria Casal. Some 14,000 Venezuelan schools typically serve as electoral centers for the country's 20 million voters, but since the primary is being carried out independently, these cannot be used without CNE authorization. Venezuelan authorities have in recent months disqualified some opposition candidates, including former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado, the opposition's leading hopeful in polls.

[1/2]Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro speaks during a meeting with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi at the Miraflores Palace, in Caracas, Venezuela June 12, 2023. REUTERS/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights CARACAS/WASHINGTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Venezuela's government and its political opposition on Tuesday agreed to electoral guarantees for 2024 presidential elections, paving the way for possible U.S. sanctions relief, though the deal did not lift bans on opposition candidates barred from public office. The elections will take place in the second half of next year, and international observers - including from the European Union and United Nations - will oversee the vote, according to terms unveiled following a resumption of long-suspended talks. Multiple sources had said ahead of Tuesday's announcement that the U.S. was prepared to ease some oil-related sanctions on OPEC member-nation Venezuela if Washington was satisfied President Nicolas Maduro had given enough ground to the opposition. President Joe Biden's administration had said it would lift some long-standing punitive measures in exchange for democratic concessions from Maduro. But as the White House studied the details of the agreement finalized in Barbados, it was unclear how soon the U.S. might act or how far it could go with sanctions relief. ""We welcome the Venezuelan-led political agreement reached today in Barbados,"" according to a joint statement from the U.S., EU, Britain and Canada, calling it a necessary step toward the ""restoration of democracy in Venezuela."" However, the statement also reiterated calls for release of political prisoners, independence of the electoral process, freedom of expression and respect for human rights, issues that were not covered in Tuesday's agreement. Reuters reported last week that Venezuela and the U.S. had progressed at their own talks in Qatar toward a deal that could allow at least one additional foreign oil firm to take Venezuelan crude oil for debt repayment if Maduro resumed negotiations with the opposition. Any significant alleviation of oil sanctions would mark a further shift by the Biden administration away from former President Donald Trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign against the socialist-led South American country. But U.S. sources have said any U.S. policy changes would be reversible if Maduro failed to meet his election commitments. Oil revenues are crucial to Venezuela's crippled economy. Tuesday's meeting in Barbados, brokered by Norway, was the first between the two sides in 11 months. The talks, meant to provide a way out of Venezuela's long-running political and economic crisis, will continue at an unspecified date, the parties said, adding they are committed to respecting the results of the vote. The deal says each side can choose its 2024 candidate according to its internal rules, but did not reverse bans on some opposition figures - including Oct. 22 primary frontrunner Maria Corina Machado - that prevent them from holding office. The opposition has said the bans, handed down by the controller general, are unlawful and Washington has rejected any roadblocks to opposition candidates. ""If you have an administrative inhabilitation...from the controller general of the republic you cannot be a candidate, I want to clarify that,"" Jorge Rodriguez, the head of the government delegation told a press conference after the signing. Speaking before Rodriguez, the head of the opposition delegation Gerardo Blyde had said the deal could allow banned candidates to ""recover their rights."" The opposition has shied away from laying out what could happen if Machado were to win the primary but could not register for the general election. It remains unclear whether the often-fractious opposition would accept her choosing another candidate to run in her stead. At least two candidates who initially had been set to run in the primary have bowed out because they are banned. Maduro, president since 2013, is expected to run for re-election but has not yet formalized his candidacy. The U.S. imposed sanctions on Venezuela to punish Maduro's government following a 2018 election that Washington considered a sham. Since 2019, U.S. sanctions have banned PDVSA from exporting its oil to its chosen markets. The other accord signed by the two sides includes an agreement to protect Houston-based oil refiner Citgo Petroleum, whose parent company's shares will be put for auction starting this month through a court-organized process to pay creditors.

Maria Corina Machado, candidate of the Vente Venezuela party for the opposition primaries, meets with her supporters after a press conference, in Caracas, Venezuela September 6, 2023. REUTERS/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria/File Photo  Acquire Licensing Rights CARACAS, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition will hold a primary on Sunday to pick its candidate for 2024 presidential elections, despite the front-runner being barred from holding office. President Nicolas Maduro is expected to seek another term. The primary is the first the opposition has held in 11 years. It has not backed a presidential candidate in a general election since 2013. The government and the opposition said in a joint agreement signed on Tuesday that each side can choose its candidate according to its own internal rules. The primary could be a chance for the opposition to rally support from voters in Venezuela, whose economy has been in deep crisis for years. The U.S. has long said it would lift some of its sanctions on Maduro's government in exchange for democratic concessions from the president. Sources this week said Washington would consider some relief in response to Tuesday's deal. Opposition politicians have organized the primary without state assistance after the National Electoral Council took months to respond to a request for logistical help. Officials who are found guilty of corruption are banned from holding public office for up to 15 years. Venezuela's opposition says the government uses bans unlawfully to prevent them from competing in elections. Maria Corina Machado, who is expected to win the primary, has been barred from holding public office since June, because she supported U.S. sanctions on the Maduro government and backed former opposition leader Juan Guaido. Two other candidates, of the thirteen originally registered for the primary, have dropped out because of their own bans. The deal on Tuesday did not include lifting of the bans, with the head of the government delegation saying those with administrative sanctions cannot participate in the election. It is unclear what will happen if a disqualified candidate wins. Machado has said if she is the victor, she could put pressure on the electoral council to let her register for the general election. Others have argued a succession mechanism to replace her would be necessary, and several candidates have said there is no unified decision about what to do. It remains unclear whether the often-fractious opposition would accept Machado choosing someone else to run in her place. Tuesday's deal between the opposition and the government said the vote will happen in the latter half of 2024, but gave no specific date. Venezuela's elections traditionally take place in December, though in 2018 voting was brought forward to May.

WASHINGTON, Oct 18 (Reuters) - The Biden administration on Wednesday broadly eased sanctions on Venezuela's oil sector in response to a deal reached between the government and opposition parties for the 2024 election - the most extensive rollback of Trump-era restrictions on Caracas. A new general license issued by the U.S. Treasury Department authorized OPEC member Venezuela, which had been under crushing sanctions since 2019, to produce and export oil to its chosen markets for the next six months without limitation. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed President Nicolas Maduro's electoral concessions but said Washington has given him until the end of November to begin lifting bans on opposition presidential candidates and start releasing political prisoners and ""wrongfully detained"" Americans. A senior State Department official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, threatened to reverse sanctions relief measures unless Maduro takes such action. The U.S. moves follow months of negotiations in which Washington had pressed Caracas for concrete actions toward democratic elections in return for lifting some - but not all - of the tough sanctions imposed under former U.S. President Donald Trump. It also represents a significant step in the increased engagement of President Joe Biden's administration with Maduro on issues ranging from energy to migration, a shift from Trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign against the socialist government. Venezuela ruling party official Jorge Rodriguez, who leads the government's negotiating team at talks with the opposition, said on state television later on Wednesday that the sanctions relief affected all oil activities. ""The possibility of any person or company coming to Venezuela to invest is totally open,"" he said. Maduro's government and the opposition reached an agreement in Barbados on Tuesday on electoral guarantees for an internationally monitored vote to be held in the second half of 2024. But the deal stopped short of Maduro agreeing to reinstate opposition candidates who had been barred from public office. Blinken said in a statement that the U.S. was acting ""consistent with our longstanding commitment to provide U.S. sanctions relief in response to concrete steps toward competitive elections and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms."" Wednesday's announcements alleviated some of the toughest sanctions that Venezuela has faced but it left in place a number of other restrictions.

REUTERS/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria  Acquire Licensing Rights Even so, the U.S. measures could reopen Venezuela's doors to dozens of oil companies with frozen or reduced operations in Venezuela. The U.S. imposed harsh sanctions on Venezuela to punish Maduro's government following his 2018 re-election, which the U.S. and other Western governments rejected as a sham. Since 2019, U.S. sanctions have banned state-run oil company PDVSA from exporting to its chosen markets. The changes announced on Wednesday include the issuance of a six-month general license allowing the production, sale and export of Venezuela's crude and gas, without limitations on customers or destinations, and another general license authorizing dealings with Minerven – the Venezuelan state-owned gold mining company. The U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement, however, that it was prepared to revoke those authorizations at any time if representatives of Maduro fail to follow through on their commitments in the deal with the opposition. Treasury also removed the secondary trading ban on certain Venezuelan sovereign bonds and state-run oil company PDVSA debt and equity, though a ban on trading in the primary Venezuelan bond market remains in place, it said. The U.S. has been seeking ways to boost global flows of oil to alleviate high prices caused by sanctions on Russia and OPEC+ decisions to reduce output. But the chances Venezuela's exports could offset those cuts are slim absent a big increase in investment in the country's crippled oil sector, oil industry experts said. Two decades of mismanagement and insufficient investment, coupled with U.S. oil sanctions since 2019, are expected to stymie state-run PDVSA's ability to make a quick comeback to cash-paying oil markets and offer its crude at fair prices. Talks between the government and the opposition, meant to provide a way out of Venezuela's long-running political and economic crisis, were held on Tuesday for the first time in nearly a year. They agreed to further meetings at an unspecified date. The deal they announced said each side can choose its 2024 candidate according to its internal rules but did not reverse bans on some opposition figures - including Oct. 22 primary frontrunner Maria Corina Machado - that prevent them from holding office.

[1/14]Industrial engineer and former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado addresses supporters as she reacts to the vote count, after Venezuelans voted in a primary to choose a unity opposition candidate to face Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro in his probable re-election bid in 2024, in Caracas,...  Acquire Licensing Rights Read more CARACAS, Oct 22 (Reuters) - Former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado is leading the vote count in the Venezuelan opposition's presidential primary by a huge margin and has claimed victory in the Sunday contest, with final results pending. The vote to choose a unity opposition candidate to face President Nicolas Maduro in his probable re-election bid next year came amid pledges by the United States to roll back sanctions relief if the government fails to lift bans preventing some opposition figures from holding office. Machado was tallying 93% of the vote, with just over 26% of ballot boxes counted, the primary's organizing commission said around midnight. ""From tonight we begin a great movement for a great national alliance for the transformation of Venezuela,"" Machado said at her campaign headquarters. ""Today I received a mandate and I accept with Venezuelans the commitment of making that mandate matter."" The count - delayed by a server blockage - was expected to resume later on Monday. It was unclear when the next results update would be given. Machado's nearest rival, former lawmaker Carlos Prosperi, had 4.75% of the vote. Participation in the vote, organized without state help, was more than double what had been expected in some states. Venezuela has about 20 million eligible voters. Polling places - including in private homes and on street corners - were meant to close at 4 p.m. (2000 GMT), but many remained opened hours later, so those waiting in long lines could vote or so additional ballots could be delivered. Some of the estimated 3,000 polling locations nationwide had to be moved, according to human rights groups and voters, causing confusion. Voters also faced transportation problems. Gasoline availability was limited in border states Tachira and Bolivar and public transport in the country's interior was working irregularly, according to Reuters witnesses. ""On Friday we waited in three lines to be able to get gasoline for today and we couldn't,"" said housewife Melissa Diaz, 39, who arrived at her polling place in eastern Guyana City with a nearly empty tank. ""We've lost a whole day, but even if we had to walk or cycle, we were coming to vote."" Machado, 56, an industrial engineer, has led her rivals by some 40 points in polls. But Machado, like two former rivals who dropped out of the race, is barred from public office over her support of the sanctions on Maduro's government and would not be able to register for the general election. The opposition and government this week signed a deal on some election guarantees, including the presence of international observers. The accord allows each side to choose its candidate according to internal rules, but did not retract the election disqualifications. The United States, which broadly eased Trump-era sanctions on Venezuelan oil and gas and bonds in response to the deal, has said Maduro has until the end of November to begin rescinding the bans and releasing political prisoners and ""wrongfully detained"" Americans. Though five people were released, lead government negotiator Jorge Rodriguez confirmed this week that those with disqualifications cannot run in the 2024 contest, set for the second half of the year. Some in the opposition have said they are skeptical Maduro will follow through on the deal. The opposition, which says the disqualifications are unlawful, has been reticent to say what it would do if Machado wins the primary but is unable to compete in 2024. Machado - who says her goal is to remove Maduro in a fair and peaceful vote - has said she would pressure the electoral authorities to let her register. Maduro has not announced that he will seek re-election, but many observers expect him to run. Others have argued selecting a substitute candidate would be necessary, although whether the often-fractious opposition would accept Machado choosing a replacement remains to be seen. Ten candidates are competing in the primary, where candidates have pledged to come up with solutions for the country's long economic crisis. ""If you buy diapers you don't buy food, so I buy food and not diapers,"" said 20-year-old hairdresser Rosimar Gonzalez, who voted in central Maracay with her young son in her arms. ""We have to change presidents.""

REUTERS/Leonardo Fernandez Viloria  Acquire Licensing Rights CARACAS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Former lawmaker Maria Corina Machado was formally declared the victor of the Venezuelan opposition's weekend presidential primary on Thursday, as a government official warned foreign diplomats not to interfere in the electoral process. The country's attorney general said on Wednesday his office has launched a criminal investigation into the primary and members of its organizing commission. The investigation risks the wrath of the U.S., which last week relaxed some sanctions on the government of President Nicolas Maduro on pledges his government made of a fair election next year, in a deal between it and the opposition in Barbados. The U.S. State Department has already said it will reinstate previous sanctions if Maduro's government does not rescind public office bans on Machado and others, as well as release political prisoners and ""wrongly detained"" Americans by the end of November. Sanctions were widely expanded in 2019 after Maduro won re-election in what the U.S. and others say was a fraudulent vote. Machado, who won about 93% of votes in the primary, met with about 10 foreign diplomats on Wednesday at her party's headquarters, sparking the government's objections. ""With all due respect...don't interfere with internal issues,"" Jorge Rodriguez, president of the ruling party-run legislature, told a large group of diplomats at his own meeting with them on Thursday, as reporters looked on. The government did not provide a list of attendees at the meeting. Rodriguez, the government's top negotiator in talks with the opposition, told the diplomats the primary violated electoral rules because it was organized without the help of electoral authorities and violated the Barbados deal. Machado, however, said the investigation into the primary is a ""clear"" violation of the Barbados deal. ""We hope it does not proceed,"" she said at a press conference to announce the primary's final vote count. The primary's organizing commission tried unsuccessfully to involve electoral authorities, said commission head Jesus Maria Casal, who is among those under investigation. He did not comment on the investigation.

The court ruled the opposition’s Oct. 22 contest may be in violation of the law. It was not immediately clear whether the suspension would effectively result in the nullification of the primary vote. The Associated Press could not immediately seek clarification from the head of the National Primary Commission as he entered the attorney general’s office minutes after the ruling was issued. The commission is an independent body that formed to organize the opposition’s primary.

More than 2.4 million Venezuelans in the country and abroad voted, including in areas once considered strongholds of the ruling party. “All effects of the different phases of the electoral process conducted by the National Primary Commission are suspended,” the ruling said. The court ordered organizers to hand over all ballots, tally sheets and other documents, under the argument that the independent contest may be in violation of the law. It also ratified the bans imposed by Maduro’s government on three candidates, including winner María Corina Machado, on running for office. Machado, a former lawmaker and longtime government foe, was officially declared the primary’s winner Thursday after earning more than 90 percent of the vote.

CARACAS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Venezuela's Supreme Justice Tribunal said on Monday it has suspended the results of an opposition presidential primary that took place this month, despite an electoral deal between the government and the opposition that allows each side to choose its candidate. The ruling could risk the wrath of the United States, which this month rolled back some oil and gas industry and bond trading sanctions in exchange for the electoral deal. The U.S. State Department has already said it will reinstate sanctions if the government of President Nicolas Maduro does not lift bans on some opposition candidates and free political prisoners and ""wrongfully detained"" Americans by the end of November. The decision by the court, which the opposition considers an arm of the government, comes after the attorney general announced last week that his office is investigating the primary and members of its organizing commission for electoral violations, financial crimes and conspiracy. Members of the organizing commission were meeting with prosecutors on Monday for interviews related to the case, the commission said on social media. The opposition and the primary's winner Maria Corina Machado have insisted repeatedly the Oct. 22 vote was transparent and fair. The government has decried alleged fraud since the day of the vote, which was organized without state help and which attracted more than 2.3 million voters. The government of Maduro, in power for a decade, and the opposition signed an electoral deal in Barbados, agreeing to international observers and that each side can choose its candidate according to internal rules.

""The U.S. government will take action if Maduro and his representatives do not meet their commitments."" Both the investigation and the ruling come at the request of lawmaker Jose Brito, who the court said wanted to participate in the primary. Brito does not belong to any of the parties that took part. ""Following the request of preventative protection and in consequence, all the effects of the distinct phases of the electoral process conducted by the National Primary Commission are suspended,"" the tribunal said on its website. The commission must present all documents related to its creation, candidate registration, voting records and other documents, the tribunal said. The commission must also account for the participation of candidates like Machado, who is barred from holding public office in a decision the opposition says is illegal. The ruling ""temporarily suspends the primary until there is a final decision from the tribunal,"" said lawyer and university professor Jose Vicente Haro. ""The tribunal is late to the decision because it comes after the primary. They shouldn't have accepted the petition."" Some observers said the opposition parties that participated in the primary should simply recognize Machado once again as their unity candidate, making any ruling on the contest moot. The opposition this month declined electoral authorities' offer of help organize the primary, and its request to delay the vote until November, after the authorities took several months to respond to the opposition's request for assistance.

On Jan. 6, 2021, supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol, injuring scores of law enforcement officers, forcing a panicked evacuation of the nation's political leaders, and threatening the peaceful transfer of power. Five people died during or soon after the riot, and more than $2.9 million worth of damage was done to the Capitol and grounds. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has estimated that 2,000 people may have been involved that day, and considers the attack an act of domestic terrorism. In response, the Department of Justice launched the largest criminal investigation in U.S. history. NPR is tracking every criminal case stemming from that day's events.

""What we've decided is that we will probably make referrals – as to how many, we've not decided on the number,"" he said. Thompson added: ""We have not made a decision as to who, but we have made decisions that criminal referrals will happen."" Asked whether there is a list of people the panel is considering for referrals, Thompson said, ""Yes, but I can't give them to you right now."" The committee is meeting virtually Tuesday evening to continue discussions on potential criminal referrals. They met on Friday morning behind closed doors to consider a range of topics — including whether to issue potential criminal referrals for former President Trump and others.  The panel is expected to meet throughout this week and could share its plans on criminal referrals by Friday, Thompson said. Trump, the central player in the panel's investigation into the violence that erupted on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, was subpoenaed by the panel in October. Trump has not cooperated.  The committee has held a series of public hearings laying out its findings and is expected to present a comprehensive report before the end of the month. Thompson called the report a ""work in progress.""  ""We're actually going over printed material now, scrubbing stuff,"" he said, noting the report is ""quite lengthy"" at eight chapters long. The report is expected to include information that hasn't been made public during the previous hearings and the committee also plans to share hundreds of transcripts of the over 1,000 witnesses it interviewed. Thompson said the final report will likely be introduced in ""some public format,"" but wouldn't speculate on whether it would take the form of another public committee hearing.

       The House select committee investigating the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack is weighing criminal referrals for former President Donald Trump and a number of his closest allies, multiple sources tell CNN.           The sources would not elaborate on who besides Trump is being considered.            Criminal referrals would largely be symbolic in nature. The committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and the Justice Department does not need a referral from Congress to investigate crimes as it has its own criminal investigations into the Capitol attack ongoing.           Committee members see criminal referrals as a critical part of their work, putting their views on the record in order to complete their investigation – not as a way to pressure DOJ, one of the sources told CNN.            “The committee wants to make sure nothing falls between the cracks and make an emphatic statement who it has identified as key organizers,” of the insurrection, a separate source said.            Committee members met Tuesday evening to further discuss criminal referrals, but sources say they don’t expect the panel to release the names of who would be subject to a criminal referral at this point.     January 6 committee member says entirety of panel's work will be released in coming weeks         Members still need to vote on the final list of criminal referrals, which sources say still is not finalized.           The committee’s chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, told reporters earlier Tuesday that the panel has decided to make criminal referrals to the Department of Justice but had not narrowed down the universe of individuals who may be referred.           Asked whether Thompson believed any witnesses perjured themselves, he said, “that’s part of the discussion.”           When the panel makes referrals, Thompson said it will be a separate document from the panel’s final report that will be sent to DOJ.            The committee is aiming to release its final report and vote publicly on criminal referrals on December 21, Thompson told reporters Wednesday. “There will be some form of public presentation. We haven’t decided exactly what that would be,” he said.           A select committee spokesperson confirmed to CNN that criminal referrals will be “considered as a final part” of the panel’s work.           “The Committee has determined that referrals to outside entities should be considered as a final part of its work. The committee will make decisions about specifics in the days ahead,” the spokesperson said.           A source also told CNN on Tuesday that the criminal referrals the January 6 committee will ultimately be making “will be focused on the main organizers and leaders of the attacks.”           A subcommittee of members was tasked with providing options to the full committee about how to present evidence of possible obstruction, possible perjury and possible witness tampering as well as potential criminal referrals to the Department of Justice, according to multiple sources familiar with the committee’s work.           Democratic Reps. Jamie Raskin, Adam Schiff and Zoe Lofgren, and GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the panel, all trained lawyers, comprise this subcommittee.            Raskin told CNN on Wednesday that everything is “still on track” but no decisions have been made following the Tuesday meeting as the committee works through where to “draw the line” when it comes to referrals because there is such a “broad universe” of potential offenses and offenders.     MAGA-world keeps losing in its efforts to tie up Trump criminal probes in court          Committee members are on the same page, broadly speaking, Raskin told CNN, but a decision on who they ultimately refer to the Justice Department for prosecution – and for what offenses – is still a work in progress.           But Schiff told CNN there is a “consensus among the members” regarding the referrals and that members are taking a unified approach on that front.           The decision of whether to issue criminal referrals has loomed large over the committee. Members on the panel have been in wide agreement that Trump and some of his closest allies have committed a crime when he pushed a conspiracy to prevent the peaceful transfer of power, as they’ve laid out in their hearings. But they have long been split over what to do about it, including whether to make a criminal referral of Trump to the Justice Department.           In the past, the question has led to a vigorous, at times contentious, debate among committee members, sources have said. Those who previously said criminal referrals are not necessary to close out the panel’s investigation say the committee lacks prosecutorial powers, and that the Justice Department does not need Congress to investigate crimes as it has its own criminal investigations into the Capitol attack that are ongoing.           Still, the idea of a criminal referral","(2022, 12, 7)"

 Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — The House Jan. 6 committee met Sunday to finalize its plans to issue at least three criminal referrals for former President Donald Trump, NBC News has learned exclusively. The committee, gathering publicly Monday, is expected to vote on referrals asking the Justice Department to pursue at least three criminal charges against Trump related to the Capitol riot: obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the government and inciting or assisting an insurrection. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., said in part during the meeting overheard by NBC News that he believed referrals were “warranted.” A source familiar with the committee’s plans told NBC News about the meeting and its location in the Capitol complex.  The committee did not respond to requests for comment.  NBC News previously reported that obstruction, conspiracy and incitement of an insurrection were among the charges the committee was considering to recommend against Trump. The criminal referrals carry no official legal weight, and it remains up to the Justice Department to decide whether or not to charge Trump and anyone else the committee might refer. Sources confirmed after the meeting that the discussions in the room were a review of decisions the committee made previously that would be presented Monday and that the meeting served as a rehearsal of sorts. The committee also discussed John Eastman, a conservative lawyer on Trump's legal team who authored a memo outlining a theory of how Trump could hold on to power on Jan. 6. Eastman, via his attorney, declined to comment. The committee also plans to refer several Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee for their defiance of congressional subpoenas, NBC News has learned. “None of the subpoenaed members complied,” Raskin said during Sunday’s meetings, presenting the findings of the subcommittee responsible for referrals. “And we are now referring four members of Congress for appropriate sanction with the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply.” Asked for comment, a Trump campaign spokesperson shared a statement from Friday attacking the committee, adding that the campaign will have more to say after the referrals are made public Monday. The bipartisan committee, which is winding down its work before the end of the year, has rushed to file its findings into a lengthy, eight-chapter report set to be released to the public Wednesday.

 Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — The House Jan. 6 committee voted Monday to recommend that the Justice Department pursue a batch of criminal charges against former President Donald Trump for his role in an effort to overturn the 2020 election and the fomenting of a deadly mob at the Capitol. Trump was the first president in American history to be impeached twice. Now, he is also the first president to be formally referred by Congress for potential prosecution. The committee's final meeting was the culmination of a sweeping 17-month congressional investigation that included more than 100 subpoenas, interviews with more than 1,200 witnesses and the collection of hundreds of thousands of documents.  The select committee also took aim at Trump’s top allies — on and off Capitol Hill — who worked with the former president to block certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s election victory and illegitimately keep Trump in power. “We understand the gravity of each and every referral we are making today, just as we understand the magnitude of the crime against democracy that we describe in our report,” said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., who led the Jan. 6 subcommittee that examined referrals. “But we have gone where the facts and the law lead us, and inescapably they lead us here.”  The Jan. 6 panel also issued a criminal referral to the Department of Justice for conservative attorney John Eastman, who the committee says was the architect of the scheme to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject states’ electoral votes on Jan. 6 and have fake electors submitted to the Congress instead.  And it referred four Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee for defying subpoenas from the committee earlier this year, including House Minority Leader and potential incoming Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. The others are: Reps. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who is expected to be the next chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., and Scott Perry, R-Pa.  Raskin said there may be others worthy of prosecution and there may be other statutes that Trump violated, noting the Justice Department will be able to form ""a far more complete picture"" through its own ongoing investigation.  Pressed why Trump and Eastman were the only ones formally referred to DOJ, Raskin told reporters there was an internal debate within the committee about the scope of the referrals. While the committee found that other Trump associates — including Mark Meadows, Rudy Giuliani and Jeffrey Clark — were “actors” in the plot to overturn the election, Raskin said, investigators were “stymied” because some individuals chose not to cooperate with the Jan. 6 panel.   “We focused on the masterminds and the ring-leaders, and we trust that the Department of Justice will do its job, as they’ve been doing,” Raskin said after the meeting. The committee is wrapping up its work before it disbands at the end of the year. But Chairman Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., said the nation finds itself ""in strange and uncharted waters.""  ""We’ve never had a president of the United States stir up a violent attempt to block the transfer of power,” he said. “If we are to survive as a nation of laws and democracy, this can never happen again.” The Jan. 6 committee is urging DOJ to consider a number of charges against Trump, including conspiracy to defraud the federal government; obstruction of an official proceeding, in this case Congress’ certification of electoral votes; conspiracy to make a false statement; and inciting or assisting those in an insurrection. The criminal referrals do not carry any legal weight but represent a symbolic rebuke of Trump, who remains the most influential Republican in the country and has launched another bid for president.  Jack Smith, the independent special counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, is already investigating Trump on numerous fronts, including for his role in the Jan. 6 riot. Responding to the criminal referral, Eastman said the Jan. 6 panel had failed to address gaps in Capitol security and the electoral system and instead chose to focus on a “pretend” criminal case.   “A criminal ‘referral’ from a congressional committee is not binding on the Department of Justice and carries no more legal weight than a ‘referral’ from any American citizen,"" Eastman said in a statement. “In fact, a ‘referral’ from the January 6th committee should carry a great deal less weight due to the absurdly partisan nature of the process that produced it.” The committee used its final hearing to summarize the key investigatory threads from its nine previous hearings and to stitch them together into a case against Trump.  “At the heart of our republic is the guarantee of the peaceful transfer of power. ... Every President in our history has accepted this peaceful transfer of power — except one,” the committee's vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., said of Trump. Cheney said that ""among the most shameful"" findings of the committee was that Trump sat in the White House watching the violence unfold on TV on Jan. 6, but did nothing, even as advisers and allies begged him to call off the rioters. ""This was an utter moral failure,"" Cheney said of Trump's inaction. ""No man who would behave that way, at that moment in time, can ever serve in any position of authority in our nation again. He is unfit for any office."" Witnesses, most of them Republicans, testified to the Jan. 6 panel that Trump and his inner circle had furiously worked to sow doubt about Biden’s legitimate election victory.  They testified that Trump launched a multipronged campaign to pressure state officials, senior Justice Department officials and Vice President Mike Pence to help overturn the election. They said Trump directed a mob of thousands of his supporters to march on the Capitol to disrupt lawmakers from certifying the results of the election.

The committee's historic referral says there is sufficient evidence to refer Trump for four crimes: obstructing an official proceeding, conspiracy to defraud the government, making knowingly and willfully materially false statements to the federal government, and inciting or assisting an insurrection. ""We propose to the committee advancing referrals where the gravity of the specific offense, the severity of its actual harm, and the centrality of the offender to the overall design of the unlawful scheme to overthrow the election, compel us to speak,"" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., as he addressed his fellow panel members. ""Ours is not a system of justice where foot soldiers go to jail and the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass,"" Raskin said. While the Justice Department, which is already conducting an investigation of Trump, takes criminal referrals seriously, it is not obligated to charge anyone with a crime. However, the House panel's referral underscores how seriously the committee views Trump's actions after the election, in the weeks leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, invasion of the halls of Congress by a mob of his supporters. The nine-member panel is composed of seven Democrats and two Republicans, Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois. Cheney was defeated in the GOP primary earlier this year, losing to Rep.-elect Harriet Hageman, while Kinzinger did not seek reelection this year. Trump, who has denied any wrongdoing, has not been charged with any crimes related to the 2020 election and the attack on the U.S. Capitol. Five people died as an immediate result of the riot, one of them a Capitol Police officer, Brian Sicknick. Nearly 140 other Capitol and Washington, D.C., police officers were injured in the attack, and several cops took their own lives on the heels of the riot. If Trump were to be charged with and convicted of insurrection, he theoretically could be barred from holding federal office again under the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Trump last month announced that he will seek the Republican nomination for president in 2024. The committee on Monday also recommended that the DOJ investigate and potentially prosecute Trump's election law attorney John Eastman for his role in advancing a plan to overturn the election results. Eastman's referral was for his alleged violation of two criminal statutes: impeding an official proceeding of the United States government, and conspiring to defraud the United States. Eastman was the author of a two-page memo that outlined a plan for then-Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify several states' Electoral College electors when Congress met for that purpose on Jan. 6. Raskin said the committee would refer four members of Congress ""for appropriate sanction by the House Ethics Committee for failure to comply with lawful subpoenas."" He did not name them, but House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy is among the members who defied a subpoena from the committee. As it made its referrals, the committee released a 154-page executive summary of its investigation. The committee's actions Monday come after nearly 18 months of investigation, which included more than 1,200 witness interviews, the examination of hundreds of thousands of documents, the issuance of more than 100 subpoenas, and public hearings. The DOJ already is conducting a criminal probe of Trump for his actions after the election, which involved an effort to reverse his losses to President Joe Biden in","(2022, 12, 19)"

 Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News There are no new alerts at this time Adam Edelman and Ghael Fobes In sweeping language, the committee’s executive summary warned that a failure to hold Trump and other election deniers accountable for their actions and statements since the 2020 election — including the former president’s recent call to terminate the Constitution — would threaten the “security and viability” of the republic itself. “In the Committee’s judgment, based on all the evidence developed, President Trump believed then, and continues to believe now, that he is above the law, not bound by our Constitution and its explicit checks on Presidential authority,” the summary says. “If President Trump and the associates who assisted him in an effort to overturn the lawful outcome of the 2020 election are not ultimately held accountable under the law, their behavior may become a precedent and invitation to danger for future elections,"" the committee continued. ""A failure to hold them accountable now may ultimately lead to future unlawful efforts to overturn our elections, thereby threatening the security and viability of our Republic."" Adam Edelman and Frank Thorp V Trump “knew enough to cancel” plans for a march to the Capitol — though he never did, the committee said in the executive summary of its final report.  “By the time President Trump was preparing to give his speech, he and his advisors knew enough to cancel the rally. And he certainly knew enough to cancel any plans for a march to the Capitol,” the committee wrote. “According to testimony obtained by the Select Committee, Trump knew that elements of the crowd were armed, and had prohibited items, and that many thousands would not pass through the magnetometers for that reason. Testimony indicates that the President had received an earlier security briefing, and testimony indicates that the Secret Service mentioned the prohibited items again as they drove President Trump to the Ellipse,” the summary stated. Daniel Barnes In a virtual news conference late Monday afternoon, conservative attorney John Eastman pushed back against the committee's characterization of his request for a presidential pardon. The committee wrote in its executive summary that Eastman's request to be added to the “pardon list” after Jan. 6, 2021, revealed his “clear consciousness of guilt."" Eastman argued he'd asked to be put on the list in response to ""weeks"" of false attacks against him. ""I said, look, given that false story maybe I should be on the pardon list, just to avoid having to defend against that — what was clearly constitutionally protected speech,"" Eastman said, adding that it ""never went anywhere."" The committee said Monday it would send a criminal referral for Eastman to the Justice Department, arguing that he was the architect of an unlawful scheme to pressure Pence to reject states’ electoral votes on Jan. 6 and have fake electors submitted to Congress instead. Eastman also seemed to offer a preview of his defense to a potential criminal indictment, saying that whether or not he acted “corruptly” would be “front and center to the case.” “To prove that there would have to be first evidence that there was no illegality or fraud in the election and that I knew that at the time,” Eastman said. “And neither of those things is true."" Summer Concepcion and Kyle Stewart As Rudy Giuliani pushed forward with litigation to sow doubt on the election process, Trump campaign staffers began viewing Giuliani as “unhinged,” the executive summary of the committee’s report says. Multiple law firms that had worked for the campaign quit after having refused to participate in his legal strategy, it continues. Campaign manager Bill Stepien, who recalled growing “wary of the new team,” told the committee he had his assistant lock his door. “And, sure enough, Mayor Giuliani tried to get in my office and ordered her to unlock the door, and she didn’t do that,"" he said. ""She’s smart about that.” Garrett Haake and Matt Korade While the committee was meeting, former President Donald Trump repeated his claim in a radio interview that ahead of Jan. 6 he ordered thousands of troops to be ready to respond in case of protests — an assertion the panel had refuted in the executive summary of its report. Asked in an interview with conservative talk radio host Dan Bongino about the committee's actions Monday, Trump called the panel ""a kangaroo court"" and said its members had failed to mention his video statement hours after the riot began urging his supporters to go home. He added that the committee also didn't mention his claim that he ordered 10,000 troops to be prepared for protests days before the riot unfolded.  The committee, however, addressed that claim in its summary. “Some have suggested that President Trump gave an order to have 10,000 troops ready for January 6th. The select committee found no evidence of this."" it said. ""In fact, President Trump’s acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller directly refuted this when he testified under oath."" The summary then quoted Miller as telling committee staff members ""there was no order from the president."" Asked for comment about the committee's criminal referrals, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung repeated a statement the campaign has used previously, calling the panel a ""Kangaroo court"" that ""held show trials by Never Trump partisans who are a stain on this country’s history."" Kyle Stewart Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., responded to the committee's decision to refer him and three other Republicans to the Ethics Committee for defying its subpoenas, calling the referral “their final political stunt.” Biggs accused the committee of defaming “my name and my character.” “They only wanted the testimony to have the ability to edit and misconstrue our statements to further their own false narratives, as they did with so many other witnesses,” Biggs said.   Summer Concepcion and Sarah Fitzpatrick Trump lawyers and supporters — including Jenna Ellis, John Eastman, Phil Waldron and Michael Flynn — were asked by the committee to provide","(2022, 12, 19)"

Getty Images and Department of Justice                                       hide caption  A selection of the 1000 people who have been charged for the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol in 2021. More than two years after rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol, prosecutors have now charged more than 1,000 people in relation to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack. These hundreds of people encompass ""the most wide-ranging investigation"" in the history of the Justice Department. NPR has been tracking every case related to the attack as they move through the court system, from the initial arrest to sentencing. The investigation has been a massive undertaking, both in its scope and cost. Every U.S. Attorney's office has been involved, as well as every FBI field office. As part of the $1.7 trillion government spending package passed in December, $2.6 billion was allocated to the U.S. Attorneys, in part to support the Jan. 6 prosecutions. In order to bring charges, the Justice Department is sifting through mountains of evidence and chasing down tips. The FBI says it has been reviewing almost four million files, including 30,000 video files. Those include police body-worn camera footage from five different law enforcement agencies, surveillance footage from the building, as well as the many videos on seized cell phones and posted online. ""For context, these files amount to over nine terabytes of information and would take at least 361 days to view continuously,"" the FBI reported when it marked the attack's second anniversary. The sprawling investigation has already doubled the FBI's domestic terrorism caseload, yet the Justice Department has indicated that it believes around 2,000 people were involved in the attack. In other words, the department may not even be halfway through its investigation. The defendants – who came from nearly all 50 states – are a tough group to generalize. Most of them appear to be white men, though not entirely. About 15% of the defendants have a background in the military or law enforcement. For context, about 7% of the U.S. population are military veterans. Police and sheriff patrol officers make up less than 1% of the population. The difficulty in categorizing this group has caused some experts concern. One in four defendants are facing assault or some other violent charge, yet the vast majority of people facing charges – nearly 85% – do not have any known connection to extremist groups. ""It's not like they all had previous convictions for violence or this kind of long running history of violent assault against political individuals or law enforcement. They were just willing to commit violence on that day,"" says Jon Lewis, a research fellow at George Washington University's Program on Extremism. ""They truly thought the election was stolen. They truly thought that was their day in the sun, that they were the patriots. They were the heroes of that story."" ""It's not just the scary Oath Keepers and Proud Boys. Communities are learning that one does not have to be so far gone, and such a follower of extremist movements, to still be animated to some pretty dangerous efforts to undermine our democracy,"" adds Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism. ""Does that mean extremism is becoming mainstream, which sounds a little bit like an oxymoron? Does it mean that the in-roads, the agendas, of those who are the farthest, most extreme, are now becoming normalized? I think the answer is yes."" Nearly all of these cases are being heard by 21 judges in the federal district court in Washington, D.C. They were appointed by presidents from both parties from President Reagan to President Biden. It's difficult to compare the rulings of judges because every case is different, but there are common themes in what the judges have been saying to the defendants before them. For one, the judges aren't looking at these crimes in isolation. The significance of Jan. 6, as an attempt to undermine democracy, is playing a part. ""The defendant was an active participant in a mob assault on our core democratic values and our cherished institution,"" Judge John Bates, appointed by President George W. Bush, told Thomas Fee. ""I cannot ignore that, cannot pull this misdemeanor out of that context."" ""What happened that day was, in some ways, as serious... an offense as there can be, given that it threatened the peaceful transfer of power from one president to another. The damage that was done on that day was both tangible and intangible,"" Judge Timothy Kelly, appointed by President Trump, said while sentencing Tam Dinh Pham. ""Without people like you, the collective force of the mob that day would not have been the same."" The judges have also emphasized that being ""sucked into a vortex of misinformation"" does not absolve someone of their actions. ""No one was swept away to the Capitol. No one was carried. The rioters were adults,"" Judge Amy Berman Jackson, appointed by President Obama, told Russell James Peterson. ""This defendant, like hundreds of others, walked there on","(2023, 3, 25)"

Trump is the leading contender for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Smith already has criminally charged Trump with about three dozen counts related to retaining classified documents when he left the White House. Trump also suggested he may soon face indictment for the Jan. 6 probe, which is focused on Trump's efforts to overturn his loss in the 2020 election to President Joe Biden. Trump posted his statement on his Truth Social account. Two sources with direct knowledge of the probe confirmed to NBC News that Smith sent Trump a target letter in the case. Such letters are sent by the Department of Justice to give people the chance to testify before a grand jury after the DOJ determines there is substantial evidence linking them to a crime. ""Deranged Jack Smith, the prosecutor with Joe Biden's DOJ, sent a letter (again, it was Sunday night!) stating that I am a TARGET of the January 6th Grand Jury investigation, and giving me a very short 4 days to report to the Grand Jury, which almost always means an Arrest and Indictment,"" Trump wrote on his Truth Social site. Trump wrote that he was given what he called the ""horrifying news"" on Sunday evening by his lawyers. A spokesman for Smith declined to comment. A hearing in the classified documents criminal case is set for Tuesday in Florida federal court. Trump's lawyers have asked that any trial in that case take place after the 2024 election. Smith's prosecutors oppose that bid. Trump is separately under criminal investigation by a Georgia state prosecutor for his attempt to get election officials there to reverse his loss to Biden in Georgia. A spokesman for Rudy Giuliani, the lawyer who led Trump's efforts to undo his 2020 election loss, said he has not received a target letter from Smith. Lin Wood, a lawyer and Trump ally, also said he has no received such a letter. Timothy Parlatore, a lawyer for Bernard Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner who worked with Giuliani in the election reversal effort, told NBC that Kerik has not been given a target letter.

By          Jaclyn Diaz                        Special counsel Jack Smith speaks about an indictment of former President Donald Trump on Tuesday at a Department of Justice office in Washington.                                                           Jacquelyn Martin/AP                                       hide caption  Special counsel Jack Smith speaks about an indictment of former President Donald Trump on Tuesday at a Department of Justice office in Washington. The criminal charges against former President Donald Trump related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election are some of the most serious allegations facing him, one law professor told NPR.  The indictment is ""damning"" and represents real ""legal jeopardy"" for him, said University of Richmond Law Professor Carl Tobias. The allegations that Trump interfered in the 2020 election ""cut to the heart of democracy,"" Tobias said.  He added, ""This indictment shows how broad and deep the conspiracy was."" Trump is currently facing dozens of criminal charges in two other cases. One in Florida is based on his alleged withholding of classified documents, and a second in New York is over the accounting of hush money payments made in 2016. Here's a summary of the charges Trump is facing in Washington, D.C., for attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election: Read the full indictment below. The charge of ""conspiracy against rights"" goes back to the Civil War era. It was passed after the Civil War as a way to stop members of the Ku Klux Klan and other similar organizations from intimidating, harassing and outright terrorizing Black voters especially in the South.  This law was part of the Enforcement Act, passed between 1868 and 1870, and ""served as the basis for federal activism in prosecuting corruption of the franchise until most of them were repealed in the 1890s,"" according to the Justice Department. ""Conspiracy against rights"" is one surviving piece of the Enforcement Act.  Tobias noted that prosecutors used this charge especially during the Civil Rights era to prosecute those who intimidated and terrorized Black voters at that time as well.  In this case, prosecutors claim Trump and his allies conspired to stop people from exercising ""the right to vote, and to have one's vote counted."" This case involves more people — at least six unnamed co-conspirators are listed by prosecutors as part of the alleged conspiracy — and is widespread geographically compared to the case brought so far in New York and Florida, Tobias noted.  ""This classified documents case is more contained and it doesn't actually impact the entire country,"" he said. Prosecutors list alleged efforts by Trump and his allies to interfere with election proceedings in the U.S. and by pressuring officials in several states to overturn the results.  In this case, Trump is also facing a serious Washington, D.C., federal judge with years of experience, Tobias said. The case has been assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan. According to The Associated Press, Chutkan stood out for her tough punishment for Jan. 6 rioters. In at least seven cases examined by the AP, Chutkan imposed harsher penalties than what federal prosecutors sought for those rioters. The AP wrote, ""Chutkan, a former assistant public defender who was nominated to the bench by President Barack Obama, has consistently taken the hardest line against Jan. 6 defendants of any judge serving on Washington's federal trial court, which is handling the more than 800 cases brought so far in the largest prosecution in Justice Department history.""

Live Israel-Hamas war Live Shooting at University of Nevada Live Republican debate Recap  Trump 14th Amendment case By Aditi Sangal, Meg Wagner, Adrienne Vogt, Melissa Macaya, Rob Picheta, Lauren Said-Moorhouse, Ed Upright, Maureen Chowdhury and Fernando Alfonso III, CNN  Our live coverage has moved. Head here for the latest updates on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.   From CNN's Ellie Kaufman US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley spoke with allies in Europe by phone on Thursday, after Russia began an invasion of Ukraine. Milley spoke with officials from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Canada. He also had a ""combined meeting with the Bucharest 9 allies,"" — Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia — according to a readout of the calls.  Earlier Thursday, US President Joe Biden and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced the deployment of an additional 7,000 troops to Germany from the US to support NATO allies amid the crisis.  Milley will ""continue to conduct outreach"" to partners and allies in the coming days, the readout said.  From CNN's Tim Lister in Kyiv At least three more explosions reverberated across the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, at dawn on Friday. They appeared to be coming from the southwest of the city.  It's now just past 6:30 a.m. in Kyiv. Earlier this morning, CNN teams on the ground reported hearing large blasts in the city. In a tweet early Friday morning, Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba decried the ""horrific Russian rocket strikes on Kyiv.""   CNN teams in Kyiv reported hearing blasts early Friday morning.  Ukraine's Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Yenin attributed an explosion Friday to a Ukrainian ""anti-missile system shooting a (Russian) missile out of the sky."" CNN has not been able to independently verify this.  From CNN's Tim Lister in Kyiv The Ukrainian Defense Ministry says its armed forces have inflicted some 800 casualties on Russian forces since the invasion began in the early hours of Thursday. It was not immediately clear whether the ministry was referring solely to the number killed. The ministry said more than 30 Russian tanks had been destroyed, as well as seven Russian aircraft and six helicopters. CNN is not able to independently verify Ukraine's figures. From CNN’s Hira Humayun The European Union announced new sanctions on Russia early Friday that would target the country's financial, energy and transport sectors, visa policy, and include export controls and export financing bans. The sanctions will have ""maximum impact on the Russian economy and political elite,"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron. “We will hold the Kremlin accountable,” she said. She said the financial sanctions cut Russia’s most important capital markets, and that they are now targeting 70% of the Russian banking market and key state-owned companies. The sanctions will increase Russia’s borrowing costs, raise inflation and “gradually erode Russia’s industrial base,"" she said.  An export ban will also hit Russia's oil sector, and ban the sale of all aircraft spare parts and equipment to Russian airlines, which Von der Leyen said would hit a key sector of Russia’s economy and the country’s connectivity. The sanctions also limit Russia’s access to ""crucial technology,"" she said. Diplomats, related groups and businesspeople will no longer have privileged access to the EU, she added. From CNN's Matthew Chance in Kyiv Ukraine's Deputy Interior Minister Yevhen Yenin has attributed an explosion early Friday over the capital, Kyiv, to a Ukrainian ""anti-missile system shooting a (Russian) missile out of the sky."" CNN has not been able to independently verify this. Earlier Friday morning, CNN reporters on the ground in Kyiv reported hearing several loud blasts.  Separately, Anton Gerashchenko, adviser to the Head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, said Friday that Kyiv had been hit by ""cruise or ballistic missiles."" Photos shared by Gerashchenko on Friday show a Kyiv residential building on fire, and firefighters responding on the scene as clouds of black smoke rise in the distance. From CNN’s Xiaofei Xu in Paris   French President Emmanuel Macron is positioning himself as the mediator between Russia and Ukraine for a potential ceasefire agreement. Macron was the first major Western leader to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin after Russian military actions began. They spoke before the summit — but Macron admitted the phone call didn’t achieve much, ""since the Russian President has chosen war.” Macron also accused Putin of duplicity, saying he and other European leaders had been discussing ""the details of the implementation of the Minsk agreements"" with Putin just hours before the Russian President launched the operation, referring to the 2015 pact that established a shaky ceasefire in the region. At the summit on Thursday, EU leaders signed off on a new round of sanctions, described by European Council President Charles Michel as “massive” and “painful” against Russia and Belarus. From CNN's Manveena Suri in New Delhi US President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday the United States was “in consultation with India” on the issue of Ukraine and Russia.  The comments came in response to a question on whether India, a major US defense partner, was “fully in sync” with the United States, with Biden adding, “We haven’t resolved that completely.” India has a historic friendship with Russia. At the same time, its strategic partnership with the US has grown at an unprecedented pace over the past two decades.  Also on Thursday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken held a phone conversation with India's External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, stressing the importance of a “strong collective response” toward Russia's invasion of Ukraine, an official spokesperson said. Following the call, Blinken tweeted a similar statement, highlighting the “importance of a strong collective response to Russian aggression,” adding “Russia’s attack on Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity is a clear violation of the rules-based international order.” In response, Jaishanker tweeted: “Appreciate the call from @SecBlinken.

A Russian news agency has published and then deleted an article prematurely praising Russia's success in invading Ukraine. It applauds Russian President Vladimir Putin for solving the Ukraine ""problem"", saying that ""Ukraine has returned to Russia"" through military action. It suggests the author anticipated a rapid victory and the piece was published prematurely. The article, published by the state-owned RIA-Novosti news agency on Saturday (26 February) and described by Christo Grozev of fact-checkers Bellingcat as ""extremely shocking, even for Kremlin standards"", was quickly deleted from its website. Other Twitter users called it Russia's ""victory celebration"". However, it still remains visible on the Internet Archive website, and at the time of writing it's also visible on a regional page of Russia's government-owned Sputnik news site. A syndicated version in English entitled ""The New World Order"" can also be seen on the website of Pakistan's Frontier Post. Many Twitter users presumed the editorial piece was intended for publication after a swift Russian victory in Ukraine. In it, contributor Petr Akopov claims that Russia is returning to lead a new world order, while making good the ""terrible catastrophe"" that was the end of the Soviet Union in 1991. It is headlined ""The arrival of Russia in a new world"", but the Russian word for ""arrival"" (nastuplenie) can also mean ""attack"". Mr Akopov justifies the ""virtual civil war"" as ""Russia restoring its historical fullness, gathering the Russian world, the Russian people together"". Moscow is drawing together ""Russians, Belarusians and Little Russians (Ukrainians)"", he says, suggesting a Russian plan to increase its sphere of influence. The architect of this act of reunion is, of course, Mr Putin, who is praised for taking action now, rather than leaving the situation to be resolved in the future. ""Vladimir Putin has assumed, without a drop of exaggeration, a historic responsibility by deciding not to leave the solution of the Ukrainian question to future generations,"" the article says. It concludes by claiming that the military action ""is Russia's return of its historical space and its place in the world"", which has put the Anglo-Saxons of Europe and the US in their place. ""Western global domination can be considered completely and finally over,"" it claims. Some claims on social media say that the timing of the article's publication - exactly 08:00 on Saturday - shows that it was planned in advance by those who thought that the war would reach a swift conclusion. The publication of this article marks a change of Russian tone on the invasion in the country's state-controlled media, mentioning its motivation of returning Ukraine to ""its natural state as part of the Russian world"". But with the invasion seemingly going much slower than expected, this new narrative looks like it's been quietly shelved. Instead, state-run media in Russia continues to tell its audiences that the invasion is a ""special military operation"" to support the Russian-backed rebels in the east of Ukraine, and to ""de-Nazify"" the country. There's virtually no mention of casualties or military setbacks, while large chunks of TV schedules on state channels are given over to talk shows justifying military action. Only relatively small outlets with very small audiences are reporting the reality of events, while Russia's media regulator Roskomnadzor has restricted Russian users' access to Facebook and Twitter, in what it says is a protest against ""censorship"" by the social media platforms.  Russia's leader visits the UAE and Saudi Arabia for talks expected to include the Gaza and Ukraine wars. Security aid is in jeopardy as US Republicans insist on new US-Mexico border security measures. The US president blamed 'extreme Republicans' for holding up the funding over partisan border policies.

Live Israel-Hamas war Live Shooting at University of Nevada Live Republican debate Recap  Trump 14th Amendment case By Heather Chen, Sana Noor Haq, Aditi Sangal, Mike Hayes and Maureen Chowdhury, CNN Our live coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine has moved here. From CNN's Inke Kappeler    German Chancellor Olaf Scholz rejected the accusations made by Russia that Ukraine was preparing to use a “so-called dirty bomb"" — calling them baseless, according to a readout of the call released by the German Chancellery on Monday. In a phone call on between the two leaders, Scholz agreed with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that independent investigations by the International Atomic Energy Agency would remove any doubt about Ukraine-initiated preparation of such a bomb, the readout said. The IAEA said Monday that investigators had begun their inspection of two locations that Russia said Ukraine was using to develop such bombs. Agency’s chief Rafael Grossi is expected to provide his initial conclusions later this week. Scholz also said that Germany will continue to provide “concrete political, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine” as well as “defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity, including in arms deliveries.”  From CNN's Tim Lister   President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday that repair work continues after Russian missile strikes on Ukraine's power infrastructure — and that a majority of the missiles fired had been brought down by air defenses. ""If someone in the Kremlin has listened to their crazy propagandists and decided that the darkness in Ukraine will help pressure Ukrainians, then let them not be surprised with their losses when they see how Ukrainians are conducting ""negotiations"" in the dark,"" he added. Zelensky repeated the military's statement that of the 55 cruise missiles fired, 45 were shot down.  ""For every ten hits, the terrorists have to expend at least four times more missiles,"" Zelensky said. ""Russia's performance on drones is even worse, including those supplied by their Iranian allies."" ""The wreckage of a Russian missile that fell on the territory of Moldova only reminds us how important it is to defend ourselves together against this evil,"" Zelensky added. Some context: Several houses were damaged Monday in the Moldovan village of Naslavcea – on the border with Ukraine – after a missile shot down by the Ukrainian forces hit the northern part of the village, according to the Interior Ministry of Moldova. From CNN's Xiaofei Xu  Experts from the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog agency have started their inspection at two locations that Russia said Ukraine was using to develop ""dirty bombs,"" a statement from the International Atomic Energy Agency said on Monday.  Russia has repeatedly claimed that Ukraine is conspiring to use a “dirty bomb” — a device that contains nuclear materials along with traditional explosives — in what Moscow says would be a false flag operation to blame Russia.  The claims have been rejected by Ukraine as well as its Western allies, including the US and the UK.   The inspections are being carried out after a written request from Ukraine following Moscow’s claims, the statement said, adding that the agency’s chief Rafael Grossi would provide his “initial conclusions” later this week.  From CNN's Julia Kesaieva   Russians continue to evacuate civilians from Kherson while fortifying their defenses in the region, a Ukrainian official said.  ""Russian occupiers continue to evacuate the civilian population of Kherson and the west bank of Kherson region. In addition, they are looting all the property they can find — from equipment to ambulances,"" said Serhii Khlan, a member of the Kherson Regional Council, said during a Monday briefing.  Ukrainian forces have been making advances along the west bank of the river Dnipro.  Khlan said the looted property was being taken to the town of Skadovsk, close to Crimea. CNN is unable to verify the claim. He also said that the Russians were building fortifications further south along the east bank, close to where the Dnipro empties into the Black Sea.  From CNN's Katharina Krebs The civilian evacuation zone in the partially Russian-occupied Kherson region has been expanded to 15 kilometers from the river Dnipro, the region’s pro-Russian proxy leader announced on Monday.  ""This applies to the settlements of the Nova Kakhovka urban district, Golopristansky, Aleshkinsky, Kakhovka, Gornostaevsky, Velikolepetikhsky and Verkhnerogachiksky municipal districts,"" he said. Saldo claimed that the Kherson region remains under ""the reliable protection of the Russian army,” and that the decision to expand the evacuation zone will create ""a layered defense that will make it possible to repel the attack of Ukrainian troops and protect civilians."" The Ukrainian leaders-in-exile of the Kherson region have accused the Russian-backed leaders of drumming up “hysteria” to intimidate the population.  From CNN’s Katharina Krebs  Russian energy giant Gazprom was allowed to inspect the site of the explosions that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines in September, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday. ""Today, (Gazprom CEO Alexey) Miller reported in the morning that it had been examined. By the way, Gazprom was allowed to inspect the site of the explosion,"" Putin told journalists at a news conference following meetings with the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan in the Russian city of Sochi. Putin described how the pipe that was torn out was “bent at 90 degrees and thrown as far as 40 meters to the side, just in the direction of Nord Stream 2, which also turned out to be damaged, apparently by this explosion and fragments, the remains of this pipe."" ""So this is an obvious terrorist attack, and it's hard for us to control it, because it's all in the special economic zone of Denmark, Sweden, then beyond Germany,"" the Russian president said.  More background: In September, European countries raced to investigate unexplained leaks in two Russian gas pipelines running under the Baltic Sea near Sweden and Denmark.  Both pipelines have been flashpoints in an escalating energy war between European capitals and Moscow that has pummelled major Western economies, sent gas prices soaring and sparked a hunt for alternative energy","(2022, 10, 31)"

Live Israel-Hamas war Live Shooting at University of Nevada Live Republican debate Recap  Trump 14th Amendment case By Tara Subramaniam, Jack Guy, Ed Upright, Adrienne Vogt, Aditi Sangal and Maureen Chowdhury, CNN Our live coverage of Russia's war in Ukraine has moved here. From CNN's Jonny Hallam President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia demanding security guarantees from Ukraine demonstrates the failure of its invasion after eight months of fighting. In his nightly address on Wednesday, the Ukrainian leader said: ""252 days ago, Russia demanded security guarantees from the United States of America. After eight months of Russia's so-called 'special operation,' the Kremlin is demanding security guarantees from Ukraine. These are indeed striking changes.""  ""It shows both the failure of Russian aggression and how strong we are when we remain united,"" Zelensky added. Earlier on Wednesday, Russia resumed its participation in the UN-brokered grain deal that it had left days earlier, saying it had received written security guarantees from Ukraine on demilitarizing the maritime corridor. In televised comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin said, “having received the necessary guarantees from the Ukrainian side that the humanitarian route will not be used for military purposes, Russia resumes the implementation of the grain deal.""  From CNN's Jennifer Hansler The Biden administration approved the potential sale of approximately $535 million in Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems to Finland, the State Department announced Wednesday. The approval comes as Finland awaits approval by Turkey and Hungary to join NATO. Helsinki’s move to join the defense alliance was prompted by Russia’s war in Ukraine — Finland shares shares an 800-mile border with Russia.  “Finland intends to use these defense articles and services to increase its national stock, bolstering the land and air defense capabilities in Europe’s northern flank,” it said. “The increased national stock is critical to Finland’s defense and deterrence due to the deteriorated security situation in Europe.”  From CNN's Julia Kesaieva Ukrainian officials say that the military has struck an important target in the southern region Kherson, as the pro-Russian authorities continue to press civilians to leave. Serhii Khlan, member of the Kherson Regional Council, said that Ukrainian forces hit Russian air defense systems close to the stadium in Kherson city. Those systems have also been used to shell Mykolaiv, sometimes with devastating effect. Khlan posted a photograph purportedly showing the ""remains of the equipment."" Khlan said there had also been further hits in the area of the Antonivskyi bridge, where Russian forces and the pro-Russian administration have been operating ferries and pontoon bridges to resupply the west bank, where thousands of Russian troops remain. He said that in the city of Kakhovka —on the east bank of the river Dnipro — the three streets closest to the river were being forcibly evacuated. He said the Russians ""in the city are digging in, setting up concrete trenches."" Khlan said the Russians ""are digging in on the east bank, preparing for defense, thinking that this make our offensive impossible. But the resistance movement and the Armed Forces of Ukraine continue to fight."" Khlan repeated what other Ukrainian officials have asserted: that the Russian-backed authorities have left the city of Kherson — which is on the west bank — to set up office in the city of Skadovsk, much closer to Crimea.  ""As for the urgent and mandatory ""evacuation"" called for by the Russians, our people are not going to go anywhere. If the locals did not have the opportunity to go to the de-occupied [Ukrainian-held] territory or decided to stay at home, they definitely do not want to go to Russia,"" Khlan said.  From CNN's Jonny Hallam and Olga Voitovych    Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Iran has been informed through diplomatic channels of the consequences of Tehran sending new weapon deliveries of attack drones and ballistic missiles to Russia.  Kuleba said at a news conference in Kyiv that ""the threat is real"" of reported new weapon deliveries from Iran.  On Tuesday, CNN reported that Iran is preparing to send approximately 1,000 additional weapons, including surface-to-surface short range ballistic missiles and more attack drones, to Russia to use in its war against Ukraine, according to officials from a Western country that closely monitors Iran’s weapons program. ""A much wiser decision for Iran would be to completely curtail its military cooperation, supply to Russia of any weapons used against Ukraine,"" Kuleba added.  Iran has repeatedly denied sending weapons to Russia despite clear evidence to the contrary.  From CNN's Yulia Kesaieva Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday said he thanked Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for his ""active participation in preserving the grain deal"" after Russia said it would rejoin the agreement. Zelensky said in a Telegram post that during the phone call with Erdoğan, he also thanked his Turkish counterpart for his ""strong support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine."" Zelensky said that they also discussed ""further steps for the return of our captured political prisoners."" ""Turkey's support is important for us in this matter,"" he added.  From CNN's Jonny Hallam Russia on Wednesday said its nuclear doctrine will only permit the use of atomic weapons in a way that is defensive in nature and that the strict guidelines ""pursue solely defensive goals."" A statement from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation said the Russian military is ""strictly and consistently guided by the tenet that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought."" ""Russian doctrinal approaches in this sphere are defined with utmost accuracy"" and do not allow room for ""expansive interpretation,"" the ministry said. The statement comes amid a recent increase in concern among United States and Western officials that Russia was considering using a tactical nuclear weapon on Ukraine. On Wednesday, CNN reported that Russian military officials have discussed how and under what conditions Russia would use a tactical nuclear weapon on the battlefield in Ukraine, according to a US intelligence assessment described to CNN by multiple sources who have read it. The Russian foreign ministry in its statement said that it reaffirms its commitment to a joint statement signed on Jan. 3 by China, Russia, France, the UK and","(2022, 11, 2)"

[Follow the latest updates here.] Ukraine's power shortages, resulting from Russia's repeated strikes on the country's energy infrastructure, are becoming more acute as colder weather sets in. Warning that ""cold weather can kill,"" the World Health Organization said while 10 million Ukrainians remain without power, many face life-threatening conditions as temperatures fall — to as low as -20 degrees Celsius (-4 degrees Fahrenheit) in some parts of the country. It is believed that another two to three million people could leave their homes to find warmth and safety over winter. The recently de-occupied city of Kherson is feeling power and water shortages acutely, with Ukrainian officials telling residents, and particularly women, children and the elderly and vulnerable, to leave the city and de-occupied parts of the wider Kherson region over winter.  The government is offering free evacuation to Kryvyi Rih, Mykolaiv and Odesa, with possible further movement to Kirovohrad, Khmelnytskyi or western regions of Ukraine, Ukraine's deputy prime minister said Monday. The Treasury Department issued new guidance regarding the maritime transport of Russian oil ahead of a planned price cap in early December. The guidance complements the U.K.'s newly-released policies in outlining how domestic service providers can continue carrying seaborne oil while complying with the strategic price cap on Russian oil devised by G7 countries, the E.U. and Australia.  ""We're taking these steps to make it as easy as possible for market participants to implement the price cap policy as of Dec. 5 consistent with the coalition's goals of allowing Russians to keep foreign oil (in) flow while lowering the Kremlin's revenues,"" a senior Treasury official said. The price cap is intended to deprive Russia of a funding source to continue its war against Ukraine. It goes into effect on Dec. 5. —Chelsey Cox The European Union has sent another $2.5 billion to help Ukraine, according to the country's prime minister, Denys Shmyhal. Shmyhal said in a tweet on Tuesday that the EU ""disbursed €2.5 billion [around $2.57 billion] in macro-financial assistance."" Tweet: The massive infusion of cash is the latest effort by the EU to help Ukraine fight off the Russian invasion.  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently announced that the EU will provide up to $18 billion in financial aid in 2023 as the country takes on Russia. - Brian Schwartz Iran may be guilty of crimes against humanity as a result of producing weapons for Russia that reportedly will be used in Ukraine, said British Ambassador to the U.S. Karen Pierce in an interview. ""Even at this late stage, I do think the Iranians need to contemplate how they may be guilty of crimes against humanity by supplying these weapons to the Russians,"" Pierce told Andrea Mitchell on MSNBC. The Washington Post reported that Iran has agreed to start to manufacture hundreds of unmanned drones on Russian soil. It is expected that those weapons to be used in the conflict with Ukraine. - Brian Schwartz A bipartisan group of 16 senators asked the Biden administration to reverse its decision against sending advanced drones to aid Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion.  In a letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the senators argued that the U.S. should provide Ukraine with MQ-1C Grey Eagles, armed drones that can fly for more than 24 hours at a time.  The senators wrote that they believe these drones will help stabilize Ukrainian defenses, increase their unmanned capabilities and drive the war in Ukraine's favor. Ukraine's request for drones was declined","(2022, 11, 23)"

This live blog has now closed, you can read more of our Ukraine coverage here Vladimir Putin warned that the threat of nuclear war was “on the rise” while speaking during a televised annual session of his human rights council. Putin insisted Russia had not “gone mad” and that it saw its own nuclear arsenal as a purely defensive deterrent. He said: We haven’t gone mad, we realise what nuclear weapons are. We have these means in more advanced and modern form than any other nuclear country, that’s an obvious fact. But we aren’t about to run around the world brandishing this weapon like a razor. He went on to claim that Russia “could be the only guarantor of Ukraine’s territorial integrity”, adding: It’s up to the new leaders of Ukraine. It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: President Vladimir Putin has admitted that Russia’s war in Ukraine could turn into a “long-term process”. Speaking to members of his personal human rights council on Wednesday, Putin sought to defend an invasion in which Russian troops have been forced to retreat and even airbases deep inside Russia have come under attack. Putin also claimed that Russia would not use nuclear weapons first in any conflict, denied that Russian troops were deserting in mass from the field of battle, and claimed that the Russian military would not need to mobilise more troops, a process that has caused considerable upheaval in Russia. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said Russia is attempting to “freeze” the fighting in Ukraine over the winter to prepare its forces for a renewed assault early next year. Stoltenberg urged Nato allies to continue sending weapons to Kyiv over the winter, adding that the conditions for a peaceful settlement to the war are “not there now”. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said 31 “suspicious packages” had been sent to Ukrainian missions in 15 countries. In the past week, Ukraine says its embassies and consultants across Europe have received “bloody” packages, some containing animal eyes, in what Kyiv has described as a “campaign of terror and intimidation”. Eight people were killed by Russian shelling in the town of Kurakhove in eastern Ukraine on Wednesday, according to a Ukrainian official. Kyrylo Tymoshenko, deputy head of the presidential office, said five people were also wounded in the attack, in which a market, bus station, petrol stations and residential buildings came under fire in the town in the Donetsk region. A road accident in the temporarily occupied eastern Ukrainian region of Donetsk has left 16 people dead and several injured, according to a Russian-backed official and state media. The accident involved a minibus and a truck, whose passengers included soldiers, and took place between Torez and Shakhtarsk, emergency services told the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Ukraine’s culture minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko, has called on the country’s western allies to boycott Russian culture. Writing in the Guardian, Tkachenko argues that a halt to performances of the music of Tchaikovsky and other Russian composers until the end of the war would be “pausing the performance of his works until Russia ceases its bloody invasion”. The European Commission has proposed a ninth package of sanctions on Russia, including adding almost 200 additional individuals and entities on the sanctions list. In a statement, the head of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, accused Russia of “deliberately targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure” and of continuing to “bring deaths and devastation to Ukraine”. The US has made clear to Ukraine its “concerns” about any escalation of the war with Russia, the White House’s national security spokesperson, John Kirby, said. Kirby said the principle behind the war in Ukraine was one of sovereignty, and “unlike the Russians, we respect Ukrainian sovereignty”. Kirby’s comments came after Kyiv appeared to launch a pre-emptive strike on bombers on two Russian airbases far from the frontlines earlier this week. The Kremlin has said a US military aid spending bill providing $800m to Ukraine approved by lawmakers on Tuesday was “provocation towards our country”. The Fiscal 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, authorises the additional spending for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, an increase of $500m over President Joe Biden’s request earlier this year. Britain has ordered “several thousand” NLAW anti-tank weapons to replace the 7,000 donated to Ukraine in the past year. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, said the NLAWs played “a decisive role” in pushing back the Russian invasion, but Labour has complained that the deal took nearly 10 months to sign and the replacements will take three years to make. BP should donate its “wartime profits” in Russia to the reconstruction of Ukraine or ministers should impose a special windfall tax on the oil company to force it to do so, British MPs have told parliament. The British oil supermajor has a 19.75% stake in Rosneft, one of the Kremlin’s most important oil assets and signalled its intent to exit Russia nine months ago, after Russia invaded Ukraine. Belarus plans to move military equipment and security forces on Wednesday and Thursday in what it says are checks on its response to possible acts of terrorism, the state Belta news agency reported. “During this period, it is planned to move military equipment and personnel of the national security forces,” the news agency cited the country’s security council as saying. At least 441 civilians were killed by Russian forces during the first weeks of the war in Ukraine, according to a report by the UN’s human rights office. Many of the bodies documented in the report bore signs that the victims may have been intentionally killed, the report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said. An Orthodox priest accused of leaking information on Ukrainian defence positions to Russia has been sentenced to 12 years in prison, according to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office. The priest from Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region of eastern Ukraine, had been informing the Russians about the positions of Ukrainian troops since","(2022, 12, 7)"

See below for the latest updates.  Russia warned the U.S. that if it sends Patriot missile systems to Ukraine it will consider the move a provocation that could lead to ""unpredictable consequences."" The Biden administration is finalizing plans to send a Patriot missile system to Ukraine, three defense officials told NBC News earlier this week. The surface-to-air defense system would help Ukraine repel Russian aerial attacks. The Russian embassy in Washington said in a statement on Telegram Wednesday that sending the Patriot missile system would be considered ""provocative."" In his nightly address Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russian forces were destroying ""everything in front of them."" He added that ""city after city"" in Donbas in eastern Ukraine was being destroyed. ""There is no calm on the front line. There is nothing easy and simple. Every day and every meter is fought for extremely hard,"" Zelenskyy said in a nightly address on his Telegram channel. The Pentagon will expand military combat training for Ukrainian forces, using the slower winter months to instruct larger units in more complex battle skills, U.S. officials said. The U.S. has already trained about 3,100 Ukrainian troops on how to use and maintain certain weapons and other equipment, including howitzers, armored vehicles and the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS. But senior military leaders for months have discussed expanding that training, touting the need to improve the ability of Ukraine's company- and battalion-sized units to move and coordinate attacks across the battlefield. A battalion can include as many as 800 troops; a company is much smaller, with a couple hundred forces. According to officials, the training will take place at the Grafenwoehr training area in Germany. And the aim is to use the winter months to hone the skills of the Ukrainian forces so they will be better prepared to counter any spike in Russian attacks or efforts to expand Russia's territorial gains. — Associated Press The European Union said it approved a new package of sanctions aimed at ramping up pressure on Russia for its war in Ukraine. The package, whose details have not been revealed, was approved after days of deliberations during a meeting of the 27-nation bloc's ambassadors. The Czech Republic, which holds the rotating presidency of the EU Council, said the package will be confirmed by written procedure on Friday. Details will then be published in the bloc's legal records. The European Commission, the EU's executive branch, last week proposed travel bans and asset freezes on almost 200 more Russian officials and military officers as part of the new round of measures. The targets of the latest recommended sanctions included government ministers, lawmakers, regional governors and political parties. — Associated Press Four ships carrying wheat and vegetable oil have left ports in Ukraine, the organization managing agricultural exports from the country said.  The ships are destined for India and Turkey. The Black Sea Grain Initiative, a deal brokered in July among Ukraine, Russia, Turkey and the United Nations, saw three key Ukrainian ports reopen after a Russian naval blockade stopped exports for months. More than 13.9 million tons of grain and other products have left Ukraine since the agreement took effect. The deal among the signatories is set to expire in about three months. — Amanda Macias United Nations aid chief Martin Griffiths said it was unlikely the Black Sea grain deal would be expanded in the near term to include more Ukrainian ports or reduce inspection times.

When Vladimir Putin sent up to 200,000 soldiers into Ukraine on 24 February 2022, he wrongly assumed he could sweep into the capital, Kyiv, in a matter of days and depose the government. After a series of humiliating retreats, his initial invasion plan has clearly failed, but Russia's war is far from over. Even now, Russia's leader describes the biggest European invasion since the end of World War Two as a ""special military operation"". Not the full-scale war that has bombed civilians across Ukraine and left more than 13 million either as refugees abroad or displaced inside their own country.  His declared goal on 24 February 2022 was to ""demilitarise and denazify"" Ukraine and not occupy it by force, days after backing independence for eastern Ukrainian territories occupied by Russian proxy forces since 2014.  He vowed to protect people from eight years of Ukrainian bullying and genocide - a Russian propaganda claim with no foundation in reality. He spoke of preventing Nato from gaining a foothold in Ukraine, then added another objective of ensuring Ukraine's neutral status. President Putin never said it out loud, but high on the agenda was toppling the government of Ukraine's elected president. ""The enemy has designated me as target number one; my family is target number two,"" said Volodymyr Zelensky. Russian troops made two attempts to storm the presidential compound, according to his adviser.  Russian claims of Ukrainian Nazis committing genocide never added up, but Russian state-run news agency Ria Novosti explained that ""denazification is inevitably also de-Ukrainisation"" - in effect, erasing the modern state of Ukraine. For years, the Russian president has denied Ukraine its own statehood, writing in a lengthy 2021 essay that ""Russians and Ukrainians were one people"" dating back to the late 9th Century. A month into the invasion and his campaign goals were dramatically scaled back after a retreat from Kyiv and Chernihiv. The main goal became the ""liberation of Donbas"" - broadly referring to Ukraine's two industrial regions in the east of Luhansk and Donetsk. Forced into further retreats from Kharkiv in the north-east and Kherson in the south, that aim remains unchanged, but it has shown little success in achieving it. Those reverses on the battlefield rushed Russia's leader into annexing four Ukrainian provinces last September, without having full control of any of them: neither Luhansk or Donetsk in the east, nor Kherson or Zaporizhzhia to the south.  To bolster his depleted forces President Putin announced Russia's first mobilisation since World War Two, although it was partial and limited to some 300,000 reservists.  A war of attrition is now taking place along an active front line of 850km (530 miles) and Russian victories are small and rare. What was meant to be a quick operation is now a protracted war that Western leaders are determined Ukraine should win. Any realistic prospect of neutrality for Ukraine is long gone. President Putin warned in December that the war ""could be a lengthy process"", but then added later that Russia's goal was ""not to spin the flywheel of military conflict"", but to end it. There is little hope of that on the horizon. A year into the war, he talks of Russia fighting to defend its ""historical frontiers"" and ""rebuilding peaceful life in Donbas and Novorossiya"", spelling out that Ukraine's southern territories are part of his project, just as much as the east. The biggest success President Putin can lay claim to is establishing a land bridge from Russia's border to Crimea, annexed illegally in 2014, so it is no longer reliant on its bridge over the Kerch Strait.  He has spoken of the capture of this territory, which includes the cities of Mariupol and Melitopol, as a ""significant result for Russia"". The Sea of Azov, inside the Kerch Strait, ""has become Russia's internal sea"", he declared, pointing out that even Russian Tsar Peter the Great did not manage that.  Beyond seizing a territorial corridor to Crimea, Russia's bloody, unprovoked war has been a disaster for itself and the country it was unleashed on. So far, it has achieved little more than exposing the brutality and inadequacy of the Russian military. While cities such as Mariupol were flattened, details of war crimes have emerged against civilians in Bucha, near Kyiv, and have led to an independent report that accused Russia itself of state-orchestrated incitement to genocide. But it is the military failures that have shown Russia at its weakest: Russia's warnings to the West against arming Ukraine have gone unheeded, with Western assurances of support ""for as long as it takes"" and pledges that Nato will never be divided.  Superior US Himars missiles helped turn the course of the war and German Leopard 2 tanks are promised, even if Western fighter jets are not. A succession of Western leaders, including President Joe Biden, have made the complex journey to Kyiv. But this war is not over. The fight for Donbas continues. Russia has captured the town of Soledar this year and has hopes of seizing the eastern city of Bakhmut on the road to key cities to the west, and of recapturing territory it lost last autumn. Putin watchers believe he will seek to extend control of the four regions that he has declared to be part of Russia, not just in Donbas, but towards the key city of Zaporizhzhia. Should he need to, President Putin could extend mobilisation and drag out the war. Russia is a nuclear power and he has indicated he would be prepared, if necessary, to use nuclear weapons to protect Russia and cling on to occupied Ukrainian land. ""We will certainly make use of all weapon systems available to us. This is not a bluff,"" he warned. Kyiv believes Russia is also seeking to depose the pro-European government in Moldova, where Russian troops are based in the breakaway region of Transnistria bordering Ukraine. Neither Russia nor Ukraine give details of their own losses, so reliable numbers are extremely","(2023, 2, 23)"

From CNN’s Eyad Kourdi Islamist militant group Hamas on Sunday accused the United States of taking part in ""aggression against Palestinian people"" by sending a Navy carrier strike group to the eastern Mediterranean Sea. The Navy carrier strike group includes the USS Gerald R. Ford, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, accompanied by guided missile destroyers and guided missile cruisers.  The US is also positioning more fighter jets to the Middle East, as a deterrent to Hezbollah in Lebanon and other militant groups aligned against Israel, officials say. From CNN’s Sugam Pokharel At least 10 Nepali citizens were killed when Hamas militants attacked southern Israel on Saturday, Nepal's ambassador to Israel told CNN on Sunday. The deceased were agriculture students in the Alumim kibbutz, Ambassador Kanta Rizal said. One Nepali student remains missing, Rizal added.  Officials say the death toll in Israel has passed 700 following Hamas' unprecedented surprise attack that began on Saturday. More than 400 Palestinians have died in the Israeli military response, according to the health ministry in Gaza.  From CNN's Stefano Pozzebon and Mia Alberti The Israeli embassy in Bogota has been vandalized with graffiti including swastikas, Israel's envoy to Colombia said on Sunday. Photos posted by Ambassador Gali Dagan on X, formerly Twitter, show a pillar of the embassy building daubed with a swastika next to the Star of David and pro-Palestinian slogans.  The incident comes after Colombian President Gustavo Petro expressed support for the recognition of Palestine on Saturday, slamming the international community for treating the ""Israeli occupation in Palestine"" in a ""very different way"" from the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  CNN has reached out to Bogota police for more details about the incident. From CNN’s Artemis Moshtaghian A professor emeritus from Brandies University in Massachusetts said his daughter and son-in-law were killed in the Hamas attacks on Israel on Saturday.  Ilan Troen told NPR that his daughter and son-in-law tried to shield their son from gunfire as militants attacked.  It is unclear whether Troen’s daughter and son-in-law, whose names have not been released, were US citizens.  From CNN’s Hadas Gold in Jerusalem Israel has ""severely degraded the capabilities"" of Palestinian militant group Hamas as airstrikes on Gaza continued into early Monday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. The IDF said it targeted a structure that housed Hamas operatives and several of the group's operational command centers, including a three-floor command center. The IDF also said it targeted: Israel has been pounding Gaza with airstrikes and formally declared war on Hamas Sunday following an unprecedented surprise attack by the militant group that began on Saturday. More than 400 Palestinians have died, according to the health ministry in Gaza, and medical care has been complicated by Israel cutting power to the territory.  Officials say the death toll in Israel has passed 700. From CNN's Alex Marquardt, Jeremy Herb, Lauren Fox, Zachary Cohen US lawmakers and Biden administration officials discussed increasing support for Israel at a briefing with House leadership on Sunday night, three people familiar with the call told CNN.  Senior officials from the State and Defense Departments told the lawmakers they are moving as quickly as they can to deliver weapons and resources to Israel as part of already existing contracts, the sources said. That could help ensure that Washington provides some items as soon as possible, amid questions about how quickly Congress could act on a larger aid package. From CNN's Homero De la Fuente and Tara Subramaniam The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has postponed all upcoming matches scheduled in Israel due to the ongoing conflict, European soccer's governing body said Sunday. The matches affected include Thursday’s Euro 2024 qualifier between Israel and Switzerland, as well as Israel’s Euro Under-21 championship matches against Estonia and Germany. Read more here. From CNN staff   The death toll is rising in Israel and Gaza as fighting rages between Israeli forces and Hamas militants and as more details emerge of the dead and those taken hostage. Israel formally declared war on Hamas on Sunday after the Islamist militant group launched its deadly surprise assault on Saturday. Israel also cut power to Gaza — complicating medical care efforts as the densely-populated territory is pounded by Israeli airstrikes.

From CNN’s Josh Pennington and Manveena Suri The first evacuation flight for Ukrainian citizens left Israel on Saturday, according to Oleg Nikolenko, spokesperson for Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A total of 207 Ukrainian nationals, including 63 children, left Tel Aviv for Bucharest. The next flight is scheduled on Sunday to Cluj, Romania, with 155 Ukrainians. From CNN's Steven Jiang Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke on the phone with his Saudi counterpart, Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud, with both expressing concern over the situation in Israel and Gaza, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.  He urged humanitarian aid and said Saudi Arabia is willing to work with China to ""promote all parties to abide by international humanitarian law, protect civilians from harm, and implement relevant Security Council resolutions on the Palestinian issue."" China's Wang Yi said that Israel's actions have ""gone beyond the scope of self-defense,"" the statement said.  Saudi Arabia has been in talks to normalize relations with Israel in recent months, something Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in September described as a pact that would be “the biggest historical deal since the Cold War.” From CNN's Florence Davey-Attlee and Eyad Kourdi The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has told CNN it is reviewing the circumstances surrounding an incident in which a journalist died on the Lebanese border.  It comes after the Lebanese Army accused Israel of ""firing a projectile that hit a civilian car belonging to a media team,"" leading to the death of Reuters videographer Issam Abdallah on Friday.  The IDF statement said that on Friday afternoon, Hezbollah militants had launched attacks at several positions along the Blue Line, firing an anti-tank missile that struck the security fence of Israel near the community of Hanita.  From CNN's Brad Lendon    US Air Forces Central on Saturday announced the deployment of F-15E fighter jets and A-10 ground-attack jets to the Middle East region. The movement of the warplanes from the 494th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron and 354th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron, respectively, “bolster the US posture and enhance air operations throughout the Middle East,” an Air Force statement said. It did not specify the number of warplanes involved. A US Central Command social media post said the A-10s will join another squadron of the aircraft already in the region. Israel will start ""significant military operations"" in Gaza once they see that civilians have left, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson told CNN.  ""It's really important that people in Gaza know we've been very, very generous with the time. We have given ample warning, more than 25 hours... I cannot stress more than enough to say now is the time for Gazans to leave.  More than half of Gaza’s 2 million residents live in the northern section that Israel has told to evacuate. Many families, some of whom were already internally displaced, are now crammed into an even smaller portion of the 140-square-mile territory. Tens of thousands of Palestinians have been fleeing south through the battered streets of Gaza after the Israeli military told them to leave northern areas of the densely populated strip. Parts of the south are becoming even more crowded and overstretched, Gazans say, as waves of Palestinians abandon their homes in the wake of Israel’s statement, ahead of an anticipated ground assault by the IDF. According to Conricus, the area around the Gaza Strip is densely packed with ""hundreds of thousands of Israeli reserve units"" that are preparing for various missions. From CNN’s Mariya Knight and Kareem Khadder     Gaza residents spoke to CNN Saturday following Israel’s military announcement it is preparing for the ""next stages of the war"" against Hamas. Hind al-Khoudari, 28, a Philippine national from Gaza, told CNN she was stranded at the Rafah crossing to Egypt with her family all day and had to pull back to central Gaza because the crossing is closed. Khoudari said she arrived at the crossing Saturday morning with her husband and his family in order to leave the Gaza Strip. They encountered more than 20 families with passports from various countries. After waiting for hours, they were told they will not be able to leave Gaza today, because the Egyptian authorities want the crossing to serve “a humanitarian cause and not only evacuation for foreigners.” Egyptians told her in-laws to stay close to the area of Rafah crossing and be ready for a phone call to leave at any minute. Read more on the situation at Rafah crossing here.   Abdul Rahman Abu Ghali, a displaced man from north of Gaza City, came to the city of Deir al Balah in central Gaza following recent developments in the region. He shared his views with CNN on the recent Israeli military actions. Abu Ghali said children in his area “can’t find food to eat and water to drink.” “These are very bad days. I think they will be getting worse and worse and worse. These people have no mercy,” he added. Remember: The Israeli offensive was launched in response to devastating terror attacks by Hamas last week. Hamas runs Gaza, which has spiraled into a humanitarian crisis due to Israel's airstrikes and siege, which has cut off access to basic resources. Hamas has carried out attacks on Israel for years, and Israel has controlled a blockade on Gaza since the militant group took control of the territory in 2007.  Motaz al-Azayza, 24, a media activist and medic volunteer, told CNN he went back home to Gaza to see his family and then started volunteering with Bahrain Red Crescent Society.

From CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq   The situation following a deadly blast at a hospital in Gaza is ""unparalleled and indescribable,"" said Dr. Ashraf Al-Qudra, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Ministry of Health.  Al-Qudra said in a statement on Wednesday (local time) that the blast killed hundreds of people ""and ambulance crews are still removing body parts as most of the victims are children and women."" He noted that the number of victims and their injuries ""exceeded the capabilities of medical teams and ambulances."" Al-Qudra added: ""Doctors were performing surgeries on the ground and in the corridors, some of them without anesthesia and a large number of injured people are still waiting for operations, and the medical teams are trying to save their lives in intensive care."" More context: Hundreds of people are believed to be dead following a strike on a hospital in Gaza. Palestinian officials blamed ongoing Israeli airstrikes for the lethal incident, while a spokesperson for the Israel Defense Forces said a Palestinian Islamic Jihad group is responsible for a “failed rocket launch” that hit the hospital. From CNN's Mohammed Tawfeeq Ambassador Riyad Mansour, the Palestinian Observer to the United Nations, accused Israel of carrying out the deadly blast at the Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza on Tuesday. He said Israeli officials were being dishonest in blaming Palestinian Islamic Jihad for the blast.  The Israel Defense Forces said earlier on Tuesday that their intelligence shows a “failed rocket launch” by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group was responsible for the explosion that left hundreds dead. From CNN’s Kareem Khadder The Episcopal Diocese of Jerusalem condemned the deadly explosion that took place at the Al-Ahli hospital in Gaza Tuesday, according to a statement.  The diocese oversees the board and administration for the hospital and exclusively funds the facility through the Anglican Church via international donations. The diocese said they were observing a global day of fasting and prayers to end the conflict that “was marred by a brutal attack"" on the hospital, the statement read.  The diocese announced a day of mourning in all of its churches and institutions.  “Gaza remains bereft of safe havens,” the diocese said, and called the blast a crime against humanity in their statement.  The diocese also said “the devastation witnessed, coupled with the sacrilegious targeting of the church, strikes at the very core of human decency,"" adding that “we assert unequivocally that this is deserving international condemnation and retribution.”  This post has been updated with additional information. From CNN's Jennifer Hansler   The US State Department issued a travel advisory Tuesday warning Americans not to travel to Lebanon. The department will allow family members and some non-emergency US government personnel from the embassy in Beirut to voluntarily depart the country “due to the unpredictable security situation.” The travel advisory level for Lebanon was raised to Level 4: Do Not Travel on Tuesday “due to the unpredictable security situation related to rocket, missile, and artillery exchanges between Israel and Hizballah or other armed militant factions,” according to an updated advisory. The advisory made note of the fact that “large demonstrations have erupted in the wake of recent violence in Israel and Gaza.” The advisory warned that “U.S. citizens who choose to travel to Lebanon should be aware that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to travel to assist them.” “The Department of State considers the threat to U.S. government personnel in Beirut sufficiently serious to require them to live and work under strict security. The internal security policies of the U.S. Embassy may be adjusted at any time and without advance notice,” the advisory read. Last week, the State Department raised the travel advisory for Israel to Level 3: Reconsider Travel. The advisory for Gaza remains at the most severe – Level 4: Do Not Travel. Read more on the State Department's advisory. From CNN's Nikki Carvajal Israel feels “very strongly” they did not cause the explosion at a hospital in Gaza, the White House said Tuesday.  He said US President Joe Biden spoke with “all the leaders involved” about his trip to the region Tuesday afternoon “so that all of them could make a collective decision about the value of continuing.” Asked if the US was giving Israel the “benefit of the doubt,” Kirby declined to weigh in on where the administration thinks responsibility lies for the blast.  Biden has directed the national security team to gather as much information and context as possible “so that we can learn more about what happened,” Kirby said. As for the cancellation of Biden’s trip to Amman, Jordan, Kirby said it was a “mutual decision” between Jordanian and US officials.  Biden was set to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas and others in Jordan, but Abbas canceled his meeting with Biden earlier Tuesday.  The White House said that was due to a three-day mourning period. Asked why the president didn’t push his trip back until after the three-day mourning period, Kirby said there was still a “pretty robust agenda” for Biden on the ground in Israel. “He wants to have these discussions directly with Prime Minister Netanyahu and the war cabinet,” Kirby said. “He's looking forward to having an opportunity to thank the first responders, he obviously feels it's important, as is his normal desire, to talk to family members who are suffering and anxious and worried and grieving.” “Even though the Amman portion isn't going to happen — again for perfectly understandable reasons — that doesn't negate the reason for going,” Kirby said.

Powell and Amir Vera, CNN Our live coverage of the conflict in Israel and Gaza has moved here. From CNN staff The US, Egypt and Israel have all signaled readiness for aid to begin moving into Gaza, following a high-profile visit to Israel by US President Joe Biden.  The glimmer of hope for civilian relief in Gaza comes one day after a devastating hospital blast in the enclave that likely killed hundreds and infuriated the region. Here are other headlines you should know: From CNN’s Kathleen Magramo and Sophie Jeong A fourth Filipino citizen has been confirmed dead following Hamas' October 7 attack in Israel, the official Philippine News Agency (PNA) reported Thursday, citing authorities. The victim was a caregiver at a communal settlement, PNA reported. Two Filipino citizens remain missing, according to officials. On Wednesday, 16 Filipino workers and a child returned to the Philippines from Israel, PNA reported. From CNN's Kayla Tausche   President Joe Biden plans to argue the US should continue funding wars in both Ukraine and Israel during an Oval Office address Thursday, according to two administration officials. The primetime address will take place the eve of the White House requesting north of $100 billion from Congress to deliver aid and resources to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the US border with Mexico. Biden is expected to make the argument that supporting Ukraine and Israel is a matter of US national security at a time when the world is at an inflection point. Public opinion has been mixed on the conflicts. In a recent CNN poll, nearly all respondents were sympathetic with the Israeli people in the wake of surprise attacks launched by Hamas, but there was no clear consensus on the right level of US involvement. One-third (35%) said the US is providing the right amount of assistance – and another 36% were unsure whether the level of US assistance is appropriate. The US has long provided security assistance with Israel, which receives roughly $4 billion annually under a 10-year memorandum of understanding. The new request would provide billions more. By contrast, support to sustain aid to Ukraine has waned significantly. An August CNN poll found 55% of respondents said Congress should not pass more funding to aid Ukraine. The partisan divide has been deepening, too: Nearly three-quarters of Republicans opposed more funding for Ukraine, while 62% of Democrats supported it. Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the White House and Congress have provided more than $75 billion in funding to Kyiv, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. The Biden administration in August delivered its last so-called supplemental funding request, which encapsulates unique requests beyond traditional government programs. The proposal requested $24.1 billion to aid Ukraine through the end of the year, but Congress failed to approve it during a process to greenlight short-term federal funding. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen pledged to European leaders that the US would be able to secure support for additional aid and, in an interview with Sky News, said Washington could afford financing two wars at once. From CNN staff   The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Wednesday released drone video recorded over the Al-Ahli Baptist Hospital in Gaza a day after the deadly blast. During the video an Israeli drone operator can be heard describing in Hebrew the layout of hospital buildings. ""This here, there is nothing here,"" the drone operator says, according to a CNN translation. Gaza officials have blamed Israel for the blast, which the Palestinian Ministry of Health says killed hundreds of civilians. But the IDF rejected the allegation, claiming the blast was caused by a ""failed rocket launch"" by Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants. CNN cannot independently confirm what caused the explosion.  From CNN's Sharon Braithwaite and journalist Magdy Samaan  Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and US President Joe Biden discussed in a phone call Wednesday ways to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza through the Rafah border crossing, the Egyptian Presidency said in a statement. The talks between the two leaders focused ""on the humanitarian situation in Gaza and ways to facilitate the implementation of humanitarian aid,"" according to the statement. Biden told reporters on Air Force One that el-Sisi agreed to allow 20 trucks through the key crossing. Egypt's statement said officials in the two nations are coordinating with international humanitarian organizations — supervised by the United Nations — to deliver aid. ""Biden expresses his thanks and appreciation for the efforts of the Egyptian leadership towards achieving peace and stability in the region,"" the Egyptian statement said.  From CNN’s Casey Tolan, Matthew Chance, Florence Davey-Attlee, Scott Glover and Curt Devine   When Hamas militants broke through the Gaza fence in this month’s unprecedented attack on Israel, the kibbutz of Mefalsim — less than 2 miles from the border — was on the front lines. Toting AK-47 rifles and grenade launchers, one group of militants headed straight for the community’s gates, while another group moved to destroy its generator, according to security videos and local residents. That precision, local Israeli security personnel say, was no accident: The fighters seemed to have known exactly where they were headed. CNN has reviewed documents that Israeli officials say were Hamas attack plans, which suggest that the group collected remarkably granular detail on its targets. But neither of the attacks went according to plan – thanks in part to a handful of volunteer guards who defended their neighbors in dramatic firefights. Photos of the plan to attack Mefalsim were posted online by an Israeli first responder group, which said it was recovered from the body of a slain Hamas fighter. Two local Israeli security personnel told CNN they independently saw photos of the plan, and it closely matched the Hamas fighters’ tactics during the attack. The color-coded document includes detailed information about","(2023, 10, 18)"

From CNN's Kevin Liptak in Wilmington, Delaware   Vice President Kamala Harris said in an interview that the US has “absolutely no intention” of sending American combat troops into Israel or Gaza amid fears over a wider regional conflict. Harris, who has been included in briefings and phone calls on the Middle East crisis, closely stuck to the administration’s approach: Supporting Israel’s right to defend itself while also calling for the protection of civilians. Read more from Harris' interview. From CNN Staff   The number of children reported killed in Gaza during Israel’s military campaign over the past three weeks has surpassed the annual number of children killed in armed conflict globally in each of the past four years, according to Save the Children. More than 3,000 children have been reported killed in Gaza since October 7 by the enclave's Hamas-controlled health authorities.  A total of 2,985 children were killed across 24 countries in 2022, 2,515 were killed in 2021 and 2,674 in 2020, according to the United Nations secretary general's annual report on children and armed conflict, cited by Save the Children. In 2019, the UN reported 4,019 children were killed in conflicts around the world.  Save the Children has added its voice to those calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.    From CNN’s Pierre Meilhan Close US ally Jordan has asked Washington to deploy Patriot missiles to strengthen its air defenses at its borders, a Jordanian military spokesperson told state media on Sunday.  The request comes at a time of heightening tensions in the Middle East due to the war in Gaza as well as clashes on the Lebanon-Israel border between Hezbollah and Israeli forces.  Al-Hiyari said Jordan is facing ongoing threats, including ballistic missiles, from the north, east and west and the Patriot air defense system is “the best weapon to confront such a threat.” Jordan is also requesting a system to combat drones that are used on drug smuggling, as they “have become a threat to all our fronts,” Al-Hiyari added. CNN has reached out to US officials for comment.  From CNN's Hadas Gold Israeli forces struck military infrastructure in Syrian territory following launches toward Israel from the country, Israel's military said Monday.  Israeli warplanes regularly bomb targets in Syria, where the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights separates Israel from Iran-aligned fighters. Iran's president said Sunday that Israel's offensive in Gaza had ""crossed the red lines,"" as the US national security adviser warned of an ""elevated risk"" of the war expanding into a broader Middle East conflict. From CNN staff The UN warns ""civil order"" is deteriorating in Gaza after weeks of siege and bombardment, with people breaking into warehouses to take survival essentials.  Here are today's top headlines: More on the warehouse break-ins: The United Nations World Food Programme said some of its aid supplies were looted in Gaza and warned of ""growing hunger and desperation"" in a news release Sunday. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East said earlier Sunday that ""thousands"" of people had broken into some of its warehouses and distribution centers in the central and southern areas of the strip, ""taking wheat flour and other basic survival items like hygiene supplies."" The UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting Monday: The United Arab Emirates, the only Arab country with a seat in the UN Security Council at the moment, will seek a binding resolution from other Security Council members for an ""immediate humanitarian pause"" in the fighting, sources said. Earlier this month, the United States vetoed a draft resolution at the UNSC which called for a humanitarian pause.  Gaza's second-largest hospital suffers extensive damage: Israeli airstrikes have “caused extensive damage to hospital departments and exposed residents and patients to suffocation” at the Al-Quds Hospital, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society said Sunday, accusing Israel of “deliberately” launching the airstrikes next to Gaza City's second-largest hospital ""with the aim of forcing the medical staff, displaced people, and patients to evacuate the hospital.” The organization said it has received a warning Sunday from Israel to immediately evacuate the hospital ahead of possible bombardment, which the World Health Organization has said would be ""impossible"" without endangering patients' lives. Israel appears to have advanced over two miles into Gaza: The troops in the video, taken on Saturday, are seen putting an Israeli flag on a Gaza resort hotel's roof. CNN geolocated the video to an area just over two miles from the Gaza-Israeli border. The video is one of the first glimpses into where Israeli ground forces have been, and what they've been doing, during the expanded ground operations in Gaza. A communications blackout in Gaza has significantly hampered the flow of information out of it, though providers said service was gradually being restored Sunday. Iran says Israel has ""crossed the red lines"" in Gaza: Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi said Sunday Israel's actions ""may force everyone to take action."" There are concerns that Israel's fierce military campaign in Gaza will open up more fronts. There is already crossfire exchanges on northern Israel and southern Lebanon border — separate from Israel's fighting with Hamas farther south, which is centered around Gaza. But an uptick in clashes with Hezbollah has raised fears that the powerful Lebanese paramilitary group could actively participate in the conflict. It comes as the US national security adviser warned of an ""elevated risk"" of the war expanding into a broader Middle East conflict. Aid trucks cross from Egypt into Gaza: The Palestinian Red Crescent said it received 10 aid trucks via the Rafah border crossing, stating that the trucks contain ""food supplies and medical necessities. The total number of received trucks so far has reached 94, while fuel has not been allowed to enter yet.

Five armed Palestinian groups joined Hamas in the deadly 7 October attack on Israel after training together in military-style exercises from 2020 onwards, BBC News analysis shows. The groups carried out joint drills in Gaza which closely resembled the tactics used during the deadly assault - including at a site less than 1km (0.6 miles) from the barrier with Israel - and posted them on social media.  They practised hostage-taking, raiding compounds and breaching Israel's defences during these exercises, the last of which was held just 25 days before the attack. BBC Arabic and BBC Verify have collated evidence which shows how Hamas brought together Gaza's factions to hone their combat methods - and ultimately execute a raid into Israel which has plunged the region into war.  On 29 December 2020, Hamas's overall leader Ismail Haniyeh declared the first of four drills codenamed Strong Pillar a ""strong message and a sign of unity"" between Gaza's various armed factions. As the most powerful of Gaza's armed groups, Hamas was the dominant force in a coalition which brought together 10 other Palestinian factions in a war games-style exercise overseen by a ""joint operation room"". The structure was set up in 2018 to coordinate Gaza's armed factions under a central command.  Prior to 2018, Hamas had formally coordinated with Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), Gaza's second largest armed faction and - like Hamas - a proscribed terrorist organisation in the UK and other countries. Hamas had also fought alongside other groups in previous conflicts, but the 2020 drill was billed in propaganda as evidence a wider array of groups were being unified. Hamas's leader said the first drill reflected the ""permanent readiness"" of the armed factions. The 2020 exercise was the first of four joint drills held over three years, each of which was documented in polished videos posted on public social media channels.  The BBC has visually identified 10 groups, including PIJ, by their distinctive headbands and emblems training alongside Hamas during the Strong Pillar drills in footage posted on the messaging app Telegram. Following the 7 October attack, five of the groups went on to post videos claiming to show them taking part in the assault. Three others issued written statements on Telegram claiming to have participated.  The role of these groups has come into sharp focus as pressure builds on Hamas to find dozens of women and children believed to have been taken as captives from Israel into Gaza by other factions on 7 October. Three groups - PIJ, the Mujahideen Brigades and Al-Nasser Salah al-Deen Brigades - claim to have seized Israeli hostages, alongside Hamas, on that day.  Efforts to extend the temporary truce in Gaza were said to be hinging on Hamas locating those hostages. While these groups are drawn from a broad ideological spectrum ranging from hard-line Islamist to relatively secular, all shared a willingness to use violence against Israel. Hamas statements repeatedly stressed the theme of unity between Gaza's disparate armed groups. The group suggested they were equal partners in the joint drills, whilst it continued to play a leading role in the plans to attack Israel. Footage from the first drill shows masked commanders in a bunker appearing to conduct the exercise, and begins with a volley of rocket fire. It cuts to heavily armed fighters overrunning a mocked-up tank marked with an Israeli flag, detaining a crew member and dragging him away as a prisoner, as well as raiding buildings.  We know from videos and harrowing witness statements that both tactics were used to capture soldiers and target civilians on 7 October, when around 1,200 people were killed and an estimated 240 hostages were taken. The second Strong Pillar drill was held almost exactly one year later. Ayman Nofal, a commander in the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades - the official name for Hamas's armed wing - said the aim of the exercise on 26 December 2021 was to ""affirm the unity of the resistance factions"". He said the drills would ""tell the enemy that the walls and engineering measures on the borders of Gaza will not protect them"". Another Hamas statement said the ""joint military manoeuvres"" were designed to ""simulate the liberation of settlements near Gaza"" - which is how the group refers to Israeli communities. The exercise was repeated on 28 December 2022, and propaganda images of fighters practising clearing buildings and overrunning tanks in what appears to be a replica of a military base were published to mark the event. The exercises were reported on in Israel, so it's inconceivable they were not being closely monitored by the country's extensive intelligence agencies. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have previously carried out air strikes to disrupt Hamas's training activities. In April 2023, they bombed the site used for the first Strong Pillar drill.  Weeks before the attacks, female surveillance soldiers near the Gaza border reportedly warned of unusually high drone activity and that Hamas was training to take over observation posts with replicas of their positions. But, according to reports in the Israeli media, they say they were ignored. Brigadier General Amir Avivi, a former IDF deputy commander in Gaza, told the BBC:  ""There was a lot of intelligence that they were doing this training - after all, the videos are public, and this was happening just hundreds of metres from the fence (with Israel)."" But he said while the military knew about the drills, they ""didn't see what they were training for"". The IDF said they ""eliminated"" Nofal on 17 October 2023, the first senior Hamas military leader to be killed during the conflict.  Hamas went to great lengths to make sure the drills were realistic. In 2022, fighters practised storming a mock Israeli military base built just 2.6km (1.6 miles) from the Erez crossing, a route between Gaza and Israel controlled by the IDF. BBC Verify has pinpointed the site in the far north of Gaza, just 800m (0.5 miles) from the barrier,","(2023, 11, 27)"
